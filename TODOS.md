# Day 1

### Main
- The paper’s analysis shows that in 165 of the fatalities, the agency had seen the family at least three times. In 15 instances, CPS had seen the family 10 or more times. Twice, the child protective agency had contact with a family more than 20 times before a child finally died.
- In 146 cases — a little more than one of every five reviewed by the paper — a child had been taken from one of his or her caretakers out of safety concerns prior to the fatality. In 41 of those instances, it was the same child who later died.
- **TODO**: Add call times interactive
- **TODO**: In Texas, 80 children died between 2009 and 2013 with cases already opened by child protection workers.
- sync up maps

### Missteps
- **TODO**: The newspaper’s analysis found that nearly half of the children who died were already on CPS’s radar. Of those 380 fatalities, 165 families — more than a quarter — had been the subject of a CPS investigation at least 3 times
- **TODO**: "80 cases in which CPS already had an open investigation when the death occurred"
- **TODO**: "Heavy caseloads are a concern"
- **TODO**: "85 families had previously received family based safety services; 36 had open cases at the time of the child’s death"

# Day 3

### Wrongdoing

### Caseworker violence
- worker assault numbers chart
- violence against worker reports

### Turnover
- turnover chart
- : “State officials say investigators generally juggle about 20 cases at a time, but a state-commissioned study recently showed stated that the real numbers vary wildly.” Referring to the Stephen report {STephens report}
- "Since 2005, CPS has hired more than 3,100 employees, reaching 8,234 in 2013. Its staff budget has nearly doubled, from $241 million to $469 million, over that time. Overall turnover for staffers is down from 29.3 percent to 25.5 percent."
- link bulleted findings to relevant reports
- "The state also hasn’t tried hard hard enough to fixpoor management practices that contribute to high caseworker turnover, according to a recent report by the Texas Sunset Commission, which evaluates the effectiveness of state agencies."
- " violence against caseworkers has grown"

### Overhaul strategy
- “These sweeping reforms have yielded tremendous improvement in the services that protect the most vulnerable Texans,” they wrote in a report to legislators.
- "In 2012, the state ranked 47th in the country for its per capita spending — $175 — on child protection and welfare programs, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities"
- CPS released a comprehensive review of the agency by the Stephen Group, which offered numerous suggestions on how to improve morale and supervision at the organization
- In XX instances, a child had been previously removed from the home prior to his death

### Previous removals
- “The impact of each prior removal due to parents who have abused alcohol or drugs increase the odds of deaths by a multiple of nearly 15,”: http://www.dcf.state.fl.us/newsroom/pressreleases/docs/20140106_pressrelease_attachments.pdf
