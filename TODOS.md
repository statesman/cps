# Day 1

### Main
- The paper’s analysis shows that in 165 of the fatalities, the agency had seen the family at least three times. In 15 instances, CPS had seen the family 10 or more times. Twice, the child protective agency had contact with a family more than 20 times before a child finally died.
- In 146 cases — a little more than one of every five reviewed by the paper — a child had been taken from one of his or her caretakers out of safety concerns prior to the fatality. In 41 of those instances, it was the same child who later died.
- **TODO**: Geographically, children died from abuse and neglect in nearly half of the state’s 254 counties
- ~~**TODO**: Texas’s children died of drownings and co-sleeping suffocations and being left to overheat in cars — but also of severe medical and nutritional neglect, burns, boilings, whippings, beatings, stabbings and gunshots~~
- ~~**TODO**: Stephen report~~
- ~~**TODO**: Sunset report~~
- **TODO**: Add call times interactive
- **TODO**: In Texas, 80 children died between 2009 and 2013 with cases already opened by child protection workers.

### Missteps
- **TODO**: The newspaper’s analysis found that nearly half of the children who died were already on CPS’s radar. Of those 380 fatalities, 165 families — more than a quarter — had been the subject of a CPS investigation at least 3 times
- ~~**TODO**: Turnover rate chart for "One out of every six hired by CPS quits within the first six months."~~
- **TODO**: "80 cases in which CPS already had an open investigation when the death occurred"
- **TODO**: "Heavy caseloads are a concern"
- **TODO**: "85 families had previously received family based safety services; 36 had open cases at the time of the child’s death"
- mentioned: Billy Hasel (suspect, Anderson Co.); Sania Sandoval (child); Leosha Barnett (child); Christopher Roedel (child); Kole Clayton (child); Zachary Dominguez (child); Jacob Hovorak (child); Deondra Garner (child); Malachi Cosby (child),  Crispen Hanson (suspect, Fort Bliss)

### Undercounting
- ~~**TODO**: "And indeed, the publicly reported numbers have drastically decreased over the last five years. In 2009, the state reported 280 child abuse deaths. In 2013, CPS reported 156 child abuse deaths, a 44 percent decrease."~~
- mentioned: Dakylie Hamilton (child), DeSean Hamilton (child)
