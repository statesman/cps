  ###### Missed Signs, Fatal Consequences: Part 1
  # State has dropped the ball on protecting vulnerable children
  ## American-Statesman analysis of child abuse fatalities finds CPS has missed patterns, key information that could help prevent deaths

  {{>highlights}}

  <p class="author">By Eric Dexheimer and Andrea Ball / Published January 11, 2015</p>

  In 2009, Texas lawmakers ordered Child Protective Services to start producing a public report for every child death that answered the questions it always faces following such tragedies: What did regulators know, when did they know it and what did they do?

  “What we hoped was that the different advocacy groups, CPS, every stakeholder would be able to look at this data and learn from it so we wouldn’t make the same mistakes again,” said Sen. Carlos Uresti, who sponsored the bill.

  Yet five years on, that hasn’t happened.

  Instead, the nearly 800 child fatality reports written between September 2009 and March 2014 have been dutifully produced, then filed way. The state doesn’t comprehensively review the reports. Neither do child welfare advocates.

  An unprecedented American-Statesman analysis of every one of the cases — a detailed review of thousands of pages of heart-rending documentation the state itself does not perform — found that, in important ways, Texas’ child protection workers effectively have been operating with blinders, missing deadly patterns and key pieces of information that could help protect kids.

  Uresti said that defeats the purpose of the new law. “If they’re not tracking them, then shame on them,” he said. “That was the whole idea of this – so we can learn.”

  The six-month Statesman investigation found:

  - The agency has not comprehensively tracked how often it saw children before they died of abuse or neglect — a key predictor of potential problems. Of the 779 deaths reviewed by the newspaper, the families of 374 of those children — nearly half — were visited by CPS at least once before the death. In 144 fatalities, or nearly 20 percent, the agency had seen the family at least three times. In 12 instances, CPS had seen the family 10 or more times. CPS had contact with one family more than 20 times before the child died.
  - CPS also doesn’t know whether its efforts to find missing kids work, hindering efforts to better help children who may be in critical danger. Like the recent case of Colton Turner, found in September in a shallow grave in Southeast Austin, at least 14 other kids died after they dropped off CPS’ radar, the paper found.
  - In 166 cases — a little more than 1 of every 5 reviewed by the paper — a child previously had been separated from a caretaker because of safety concerns prior to the fatality. In 41 of those instances, it was the same child who later died.
  - Unlike some other states, Texas has not undertaken a detailed analysis of the child deaths to identify families that are at the greatest risk of hurting a child, and the state is not using that information to prevent tragedies.

  The newspaper’s examination also discovered that the Department of Family and Protective Services, which has boasted a steep decline in the number of Texas’ child abuse and neglect fatalities, [may be dramatically underrepresenting](undercounting.html#skip-hero) to the public the true number of fatalities in which an adult was found culpable of mistreating children before their deaths. There are hundreds of other child fatalities in which the agency acknowledged that abuse and neglect had occurred — but decided that was not directly responsible for the child’s death.

  By excluding such cases, the real toll of abuse- and neglect-related deaths statewide doesn’t come to light.

  State regulators collect voluminous information when a child dies: cause of death, perpetrator and CPS history, to name only a few examples. This spring a consultant hired by the state to evaluate Texas’ child protection system from top to bottom {{#doc-link "1388904-stephens-grp-findings-all#document/p18/a195151"}}found that “CPS is awash in data.”{{/doc-link}}

  Yet the Stephen Group also concluded that the agency had failed to deploy that information in ways that might protect children before they are hurt. CPS did not identify “predictive trends” and “potential ‘hot spots’ that require intervention before a bad outcome occurs,” the consultants wrote.

  This summer the Sunset Advisory Commission, which evaluates the effectiveness of state agencies, also urged the agency to better identify trends in childhood fatalities. “CPS does not gather and evaluate sufficient data to most accurately assess the risk to children,” {{#doc-link "1388911-sunset-commission-cps#document/p13/a195152"}}it said{{/doc-link}}.

  By detecting critical patterns that could help the agency identify future children in acute danger and figure out what signs caseworkers might be missing, the American-Statesman’s analysis represents a first attempt at this type of work.

  John Specia, a former Bexar County judge appointed to lead the Department of Family and Protective Services in 2012, says the analysis should prove valuable.

  “I want to see what the patterns are there,” he said. “I’m sure my safety folks will look at it.”

  ### Most deaths of any state

  {{> photo-block page.photo1}}

  While any number of abuse and neglect fatalities is unacceptably high, it represents a small portion of the child protection agency’s work. Each year, CPS investigates more than 160,000 complaints of child abuse or neglect; about a quarter of those are confirmed.

  {{doc "1388911-sunset-commission-cps" "The Sunset Advisory Commission has urged CPS to better identify trends in childhood fatalities." "20"}}

  Most complaints arrive by phone into CPS’ sprawling intake center in Northeast Austin, where phone operators work around the clock. They are often overwhelmed. Although the numbers have been improving, each year about a quarter of callers hang up after waiting more than six minutes to speak to an operator. The agency aims to keep hold times under 8.7 minutes.

  An LED crawl running atop one of the call center’s walls changes color depending on wait times. On a recent afternoon it often flickered to yellow, meaning hold times had reached 10 minutes. Occasionally it switched to red, meaning waits had climbed to 15 minutes.

  CPS investigates every potential abuse or neglect death report it receives — an average of about 1,000 a year, although the number dropped to 804 in 2013.

  The cases examined by the Statesman, in which CPS determined a child’s death was directly due to abuse or neglect, represent one-fifth to one-quarter, depending on the year, of fatalities the agency investigated. The publicly reported number reached a recent high of 280 in 2009 and fell to 156 in 2013, mirroring national declines in violent crimes.

  Directly comparing Texas’ child deaths to other states is unreliable. States report their numbers differently, and federal definitions often depart from states’ definitions. Still, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in 2012 Texas led the nation in the number of child abuse and neglect fatalities — it had 20 percent more than the No. 2 state, Florida — and ranked seventh in child abuse and neglect fatality rates per 100,000 children.

  Texas officials said the high numbers reflected the state’s efforts to more aggressively assign responsibility for child deaths than other states, such as co-sleeping fatalities in which a parent was found to be using alcohol or drugs while sleeping in the same bed as his or her child.

  Yet the state’s relatively high teen pregnancy and poverty rates also have been correlated to child abuse, and a 2009 report by Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities calculated that Texas provided prevention services to about one-seventh as many children as other states.

  Texas children died from abuse and neglect in nearly half of the state’s 254 counties. About 4 of every 10 of the fatalities were under the age of 1; more than 80 percent were under 5. More boys died of maltreatment than girls by a ratio of 3-to-2. Drugs or alcohol were a factor in more than one-fifth of the fatalities.

  During the past five years, Texas’ children died of tragic but preventable accidents such as drownings, co-sleeping suffocations and being left to overheat in cars — and also of purposefully inflicted horrors including burns, boilings, severe medical and nutritional neglect, whippings, beatings, stabbings and gunshots.

  It is a dismal compilation of the state’s adults at their worst.

  ### Fatality reviews incomplete

  {{> photo-block page.specia}}

  In many ways, child protection is an almost impossible job. The margin of error on either side of the work is razor thin: When investigators fail to catch even a subtle sign of abuse, the consequences can be tragic. But if they act too aggressively, parents’ rights are unfairly stripped, inflicting damage on undeserving families.

  “There’s a constant war in the policy arena over how aggressive agencies should be in terminating parental rights,” said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire.

  Most of the agency’s work is, by definition, reactive to complaints. But officials say they are starting to pay more attention to abuse and neglect prevention. After slashing CPS’ prevention budget by a third, the Texas Legislature restored most of the money in 2013. Sasha Rasco, DFPS’ director of prevention and early intervention, says the agency intends to redirect much of that money from youth and juvenile delinquent programs into early childhood intervention efforts.

  The state has made efforts to use its data. A State Child Fatality Review Team meets twice a year to review child deaths in an effort to understand risks faced by the state’s children.

  Yet its work has been limited and, in crucial ways, is incomplete. Its information comes from local fatality review teams charged with analyzing local child deaths and passing on the information for statewide review. The local teams are voluntary, however, and chunks of the state are unrepresented. The cases they review in a given year also typically are two years old.

  Even in areas with active local death review teams, reporting rigor varies widely. Last year, 14 of the local teams did not enter any data from their child death reviews. Only 92 of the state’s 254 counties passed along data on 100 percent of their child deaths.

  And while CPS is supposed to identify patterns that might help the agency anticipate future interactions with families, that hasn’t always been done; a 2013 audit of the process {{#doc-link "1388978-cps-child-death-investigations-and-reporting#document/p26/a195206"}}found the agency{{/doc-link}} “does not focus on trend analysis.” It wasn’t until November that Family and Protective Services began tracking CPS’ ongoing contacts with families on a statewide level.

  “We need to do more,” said DFPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins.

  Texas, like many other states, also has been slow to adopt a promising prevention tool called predictive analytics — using data from past experience to target specific high-risk concerns before they become abuse or neglect cases. In Florida, where the child welfare system is largely privatized, several companies mine data to help caseworkers better protect kids.

  {{> blockquote page.blackmon}}

  “You need to quantify the risk factors kids are facing so you know where to place your efforts,” said Albert Blackmon, a data scientist for SAS Institute, hired by Florida officials in 2013 to review seven years of child fatalities to detect patterns and probabilities.

  Such data can provide instant access to crucial information such as why children came into care, whether the parents themselves were abused as children, the socioeconomic status of the family and other predictors of child abuse, said Greg Povolny, CEO of Mindshare Technology, another company that contracts with Florida and other states to crunch numbers to improve safety.

  Florida caseworkers can use the data to perform in-the-field risk analyses. “What typically happens is the problems occur and it’s too late,” Povolny said.

  So each month Mindshare creates a “hot list” of children who show immediate red flags for possible abuse, Povolny said. That allows managers to point caseworkers to the most urgent cases and provide critical background information on how best to help families before someone gets hurt, he said.

  In Texas, at least 80 children died between 2009 and 2013 with child abuse and neglect cases already opened by child protection workers.

  Specia promises the agency is catching up.

  Last year, after years of ignoring the recommendation of fatality review committee members, lawmakers agreed to pay for a new program that matches birth records with CPS investigations in an effort to identify babies born into families that have already had a child die or removed by the state. By the end of October, the Helping Through Intervention and Prevention program had identified 300 families meeting those criteria that hadn’t previously been on CPS’ radar.

  Last year Specia also created a new Office of Child Safety, designed to analyze in detail CPS’ response to previous child abuse and neglect cases. The results will help direct money and prevention programs to the highest risk families. “Now we have staff looking at those patterns,” he said.

  The program has been slow to lift off. Workers are just now being hired, and the office hopes to start its work soon.
