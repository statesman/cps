  # Overhaul strategy

  Every two years, the Texas Legislature tries to fix Child Protective Services.

  Since 2005, the legislature has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into hiring caseworkers. CPS reorganized operations, amped up its recruitment, retrained its employees, bought new technology, tried to privatize services, worked to find more foster homes and placed more children. And yet, CPS continues to struggle.

  Now Family and Protective Serves is making another run at transforming the beleaguered system. After commissioning a top to bottom review of Child Protective Services, the agency came up with a three-pronged plan aimed at developing a stronger, more stable workforce; ensuring child safety and well-being; and making the organization more efficient and effective.

  “While there is much to be done, we believe this plan contains all the elements needed to truly transform CPS,” department officials wrote in a recent report to legislators.

  It all sounds very familiar. But this time is different because the plan focuses on its internal problems, said Family and Protective Services Executive Commissioner John Specia. It’s not just about hiring the right people — although that’s hard enough — but creating a culture that recognizes accomplishments, treats employees fairly and makes expectations clear, he said.

  “I want people to do their job, but I also want them to know what their job is,” Specia said.

  Previous reforms were often heralded as a success even as they were being implemented. In 2007, 18 months after legislators plied CPS with $250 million to overhaul the system, Family and Protective Services officials said they had already made major progress in its work. Among their accomplishments, the agency said, they had instituted new training, upped hiring standards and purchased new technology.

  “These sweeping reforms have yielded tremendous improvement in the services that protect the most vulnerable Texans,” they wrote in a report to legislators.

  And in some ways, it did help, said former caseworker Dimple Patel, CPS research associate for child welfare group TexProtect. The new technology allowed caseworkers to spend more time on the road. And while caseworkers still face high caseloads, they did go decline after the reforms, Patel said.

  But high turnover, unwieldy caseloads and overwhelming paperwork continue to plague staffers. And the agency continues to struggle with a dysfunctional culture where caseworkers aren’t supported or provided enough guidance to do a better job.

  Child welfare advocates often say that even though the legislators have given CPS more money over the years, it still isn’t enough to ensure lasting change at the agency. In 2012, the state ranked 47th in the country for its per capita spending — $175 — on child protection and welfare programs, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities.

  CPS could definitely use more money, Specia said. But more cash isn’t going to solve some of the agency’s most pressing problems, such as employee turnover, high caseloads and overwhelming paperwork for its workers.

  Earlier this year, CPS released a comprehensive review of the agency by the Stephen Group, which offered numerous suggestions on how to improve morale and supervision at the organization. That report triggered the latest overhaul of the agency, one that officials hope will help slow the ongoing exodus of its workers.

  Its initiatives include revamping its technology so caseworkers spend less time on paperwork, increasing mentoring, revising policies and beefing up its prevention and early intervention programs. The agency improve on-the-job training for employees and managers.

  The agency is also revamping the way it recruits people. Instead of sporadically looking for people at job fairs, officials say they will now collaborate with colleges to promote careers in child protection and search for people with more diverse backgrounds.
