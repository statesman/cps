  # CPS once again faces overhaul, but leaders say this one is different
  ## Plan focuses on internal problems with goals of stabilizing workforce and making agency more efficient

  Every two years, the Texas Legislature tries to fix Child Protective Services.

  Since 2005, the Legislature has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into hiring caseworkers. CPS has reorganized its operations, amped up recruitment, retrained its employees, bought new technology, worked to find more foster homes and dabbled with privatizing its services. And yet, the agency continues to struggle.

  Now the Department of Family and Protective Services is making another run at transforming the beleaguered child protection system. After commissioning a top-to-bottom review, the agency came up with a three-pronged plan: Develop a stronger, more stable workforce; ensure child safety and well-being; and make the organization more efficient and effective.

  “What I wanted to do is, let’s take a look at this organization that has a budget of $2.6 billion a year,” said Family and Protective Services Commissioner John Specia. “Why isn’t it operating better?”

  The rhetoric may sound familiar, but Specia said the current effort will be different because it focuses on CPS’ internal problems and seeks to transform what some have deemed a dysfunctional culture. Part of the problem, he said, is overloading caseworkers with too much paperwork and rules people can’t remember.

  “Our policies are ridiculous,” Specia said. “We have way, way, way too many policies. I get tired of hearing that someone violated a policy. There’s so many policies, it’s impossible for people to know what the policies are.”

  Previous reforms were often heralded as a success even as they were being implemented. In 2007, 18 months after legislators gave CPS $250 million to overhaul the system, Family and Protective Services officials said they had already made major progress. Among its rapid accomplishments, the agency said it had instituted new training, upped hiring standards and purchased new technology.

  “These sweeping reforms have yielded tremendous improvement in the services that protect the most vulnerable Texans,” officials {{#doc-link "1390954-senate-bill-6-180-day-progress-report#document/p3/a195602"}}wrote in a report to legislators{{/doc-link}}.And in some ways it did help, said former caseworker Dimple Patel, CPS research associate for child welfare group TexProtects. The new technology allowed caseworkers to spend more time with clients and less time on the road. And while caseworkers still faced high caseloads, they did decline after the 2005 reforms, Patel said.

  Subsequent reforms over the years have tackled a wide range of issues with more training, better screening of job candidates, an emphasis on keeping children with relatives and attempts to privatize foster care services, among other improvements.

  But child welfare advocates say that even though legislators have given CPS more money over the years, it still isn’t enough to ensure lasting change at the agency. In 2012, the state ranked 47th in the country for its per capita spending — $175 — on child protection and welfare programs, according to the Center for Public Policy Priorities.

  Many of the most recent reforms are aimed at reversing high turnover rates and increasing morale among caseworkers. But they also focus on preparing new caseworkers for the realities that await them.

  “The training is going to be 80 percent in the field with mentors,” Specia said. “It’s going to be much more like police academy training. You’re out there doing the work. We’re going to be putting them out there for 30 days to see if they can stomach the job.”

  Despite the hurdles they face, Specia said, the caseworkers who stay are devoted and passionate and save thousands of children from harm every day.

  “This is a calling,” he said.
