    When the state sent 11-month old Orien Hamilton to live with a relative, Emily Hamilton thought her daughter would be safe. Instead, police say she was in her aunt’s Williamson County home by a man who was never supposed to be there.

    Orien was among at least 86 children who died after being abused or neglected by non-parent relatives between September 2009 and August 2014, according to an analysis conducted by the American-Statesman.

    In 55 of those cases, the relative was supposed to be babysitting the children or monitoring them in some way at the time they died. In 11 cases, CPS knew the children were living with relatives in unofficial arangements. The remaining 20 fatalities were believed to have been caused by relatives whom documents indicate were not responsible for the child’s well-being.

    The number of relative-related child abuse deaths was discovered through a six-month investigative report by the American-Statesman into child abuse deaths that occurred between September 2009 and March 2014. In that investigation, the newspaper also discovered that the state had not released information on 655-abuse related deaths in which maltreatment was present but that CPS caseworkers had determined were not the direct cause of the fatality. The law does not require the state to do so.

    Days after the Statesman’s report ran, Sen. Carlos Uresti, D-San Antonio, said he would push for a new law to compel Child Protective Services to release details on every abuse-related death it investigates.

    The family-related deaths are a small portion of the fatalities examined by the Statesman — about 11 percent. But the numbers indicate that Child Protective Services has missedred flags signaling that some family members pose threats to children.

    Family members are “tremendous resources,” said John Specia, commissioner of the Department of Family and Protective Services. But it is critical to ensure those children are living in a safe environment and being exposed to trustworthy people, he said.

    “That’s why we have to know who is in the home,” Specia said.

    But that doesn’t always occur. Sometimes it’s because family members lie about who lives in or regularly visits their home. Sometimes it’s because investigators miss signs.

    ### Push for family placements

    Texas’ effort to place children with relatives is part of a long-standing, national push to keep children with their families. Federal law requires states to look to families first when removing children from their homes.

    Research shows that placing kids in familiar homes keeps them safer, more emotionally stable and more likely to remain in their neighborhoods. They are also less likely to be placed in multiple homes and are more likely to be reunited with their families, studies show.

    Texas’ Child Protective Services tries as often as possible to place children from troubled families with relatives or close friends, an arrangement known as “kinship care.” Of the approximately 28,000 Texas children under state care in 2013, about 10,000 are living in such CPS-approved homes, a 31 percent increase since 2009.

    In official kinship placements, the court approves the longer term arrangement as custody or safety issues work their way through the system.

    More informal arrangements are called “parental child safety placements” and they are designed to quickly remove children from dangerous situations. In those arrangements — which are sanctioned by CPS and do not have to be approved by a judge — a parent agrees to temporarily place their child with a relatives or friends. In fiscal year 2014, 32,000 children were placed in such homes.

    But experts also concede that these placements can be fraught with problems if caregivers don’t get the support they need.

    Texas’ kinship families don’t get the kind of financial incentives offered to non-relative foster parents. Foster parents are paid for every day they care for a child. The state arranges all of the child’s educational, medical, dental and therapeutic services.

    Caregivers in kinship placements may be eligible to receive minimal financial support for taking a child, including a one-time payment of $1,000 or a $500 annual stipend. Those caring for children in a safety placement get no financial support.

    Generations United — a Washington, D.C. nonprofit that develops public policy for the child welfare system — believes that all kinship placements should become licensed foster homes in order to give relatives access to more support, said Ana Beltran, who works with the group. These caregivers are already subject to many of the same rules and regulations of the foster care system, but don’t get any of the benefits, she said.

    “There’s this whole notion that relatives should do it for free because they’re family,” Beltran said.

    But licensing and paying relatives is no panacea, said Irene Clements, president of the National Foster Parent Association and public policy chair of the Texas Foster Family Association. Oklahoma, for example, is among the states that require kinship families to meet nearly all of the same standards as non-relative foster homes, Clement said. When that happens, they are eligible for the more financial incentives and support services.

    But that doesn’t ensure relatives will follow through with requirements, Clements said.

    “Families know pretty quickly that the state isn’t going to take those kids because they don’t have a foster family to put them in,” she said.

    Texas does not require its kinship caregivers to undergo the same extensive screening mandated before a child is placed in a non-relative foster home, but neither does it blindly place children with their family. CPS conducts criminal background checks on family members and regular visitors and inspects the home.

    Because of that, about 25 percent of family members are ruled out for kinship placements, Specia said. After Orien’s death, Specia laid down new rules for kinship placements, including unannounced visits to the homes.

    Many parents accused of harming their children have relatives struggling with the same problems: domestic abuse, drug or alcohol addiction, untreated mental illness or poor parenting skills.

    Meanwhile, kinship caregivers sometimes give the parents unfettered access to children, even when the state specifically bans it. According to the child fatality reports:

    - In March 2013, two-month-old {{#child-link "42679060-789"}}Jayden Clay{{/child-link}} died in Harris County after arriving at a hospital with a skull fracture, bilateral head bleed and a liver laceration. The boy’s aunt had allowed the parents to see the child without supervision, documents state.
    - In March 2013, six-month-old {{#child-link "42452836-768"}}Giovanni Guajardo{{/child-link}} of Dallas County died of severe head trauma after CPS said his grandmother ignored a judge’s orders and allowed the baby unsupervised contact with his drug-abusing birth parents and an insufficiently protective grandmother.
    - In May 2011, one-month-old {{#child-link "38924222-608"}}Jamyla King{{/child-link}} from Jefferson County died after her grandmother allowed the baby’s parents to take the child home without supervision. Jamyla died after co-sleeping with her parents, both of whom later tested positive for drugs, caseworkers said.

    CPS does offer support and case management for its kinship placements. But the 100 CPS workers devoted to kinship families can be saddled with as many as 85 cases at one time, hindering their ability to give families the kind of attention they need. Help generally comes through community organizations, but those efforts are piecemeal and can be hard to navigate, Clements said. Last year, Texas Legal Services Center, which provides legal services to kinship families and points them to benefits and community resources, served about 600 people.

    No state stands out as the national model on how to best help kinship families, but some have promising programs, Beltran said. In Tennessee, the state operates the Relative Caregiver Program and contracts with community organizations to provide financial assistance, mentoring, educational programs, and other services.

    Those are the kind of things families need to be successful, said Linda Spears with the Child Welfare League of America.

    “You can’t expect people simply to do something they don’t know how to do,” she said.

    ### Missed chances to protect a baby

    Orien Hamilton had spent her whole life in state custody.

    The dark-haired, brown-eyed baby was taken from her biological parents in October 2012 after she was born in San Antonio with methamphetamine in her system. She spent several months with a non-relative foster family. Then, with her parents’ blessing, the baby was sent to live with her aunt, Heather Hamilton.

    One of the conditions of that placement was that Jacob Salas, who has three children with Hamilton, was not to be in the home. Because of his history with CPS — the organization previously determined that he had medically neglected one of his children and he had been arrested twice on family violence charges — Salas wasn’t supposed to be around Orien or Salas’ three children, all of whom lived in the same Cedar Park home with Heather Hamilton, court documents state.

    But a CPS caseworker who saw him there in April raised no concerns and didn’t run a criminal background check on him.

    In September 2013, Orien’s father warned CPS and Orien’s court-appointed attorney that he believed Salas was, in fact, living with Hamilton. Orien’s father told them Salas was violent and a threat to the baby’s safety.

    A CPS caseworker questioned Hamilton about the allegation that Salas was living in the home. Heather Hamilton denied it, CPS officials say. The caseworker believed her, even though criminal court documents accusing Salas of theft in August stated that he lived at Heather Hamilton’s address.

    Orien had been in state custody almost a year when on Oct. 11, 2013, Heather Hamilton became an official foster caregiver through Lutheran Social Services of the South, a child placing agency responsible for finding and monitoring foster homes.

    On Oct. 20, 2013, Orien died after police say Salas crushed the baby’s head between his knee and the floor. A medical examiner’s report stated that the child had a skull fracture, bleeding of the brain and detached retinas. She also had several healed rib fractures consistent with being shaken, suggesting she might have been abused in other incidents before she was killed. Salas was charged with capital murder and is awaiting trial.

    “It’s devastating,” Emily Hamilton said. “It hurts so bad to know my child was beaten to death.”

    CPS admitted that it made mistakes in the case, but declined to say exactly what they were. The agency did not punish the caseworker involved in Orien’s placement. It did, however, punish Lutheran Social Services of the South, which had only worked with Heather Hamilton for two weeks, saying the group didn’t properly monitor the home.

    Shortly after the child’s death, CPS instituted new rules including more unannounced visits to kinship and foster care homes. But to Orien’s mother, it’s too little, too late.

    “She was an itty bitty baby,” Emily Hamilton said. “If they just would have listened to my husband, Orien would still be alive.”
