  Child Protective Services was warned about Brandon White’s family 22 times before he was killed by his mother’s boyfriend.

  Caseworkers received complaints as early as 1999 that the Grayson County boy was being restrained, gagged, hit and neglected. His mother admitted whipping him with a belt so hard it left bruises. Still, the boy remained in his home.

  On January 8, 2013, Brandon died of asphyxiation after being tied up at his Denison home. He was 15. His mother’s boyfriend, Robert Gray, was convicted of the boy’s murder and is serving 90 years in prison. Brandon’s mother, Holly White pleaded guilty to charged with injury to a child and unlawful restraint and received a 10-year suspended sentence.

  Court and Child Protective Services documents paint a picture of a troubled family that had struggled for more than a decade. Brandon had numerous physical and mental health problems. He’d been diagnosed with autism, bipolar disorder, Tourettes and seizures. Sometimes, Brandon was a sweet boy who loved music. Other times he spit, bit and threw wild tantrums.

  Kay Olds and others at the Evadale Independent School District knew for years that something was amiss in the White household. Olds, a former middle school teacher who testified at Robert Gray’s trial, said she wanted to help Brandon, so she struck up a relationship with the family.

  “I went into the home to see what was going on,” Olds said. “There were no blankets, no pillows, a half a pack of crackers and a couple of packs of Kool Aid in the house. It was really, really bad.”

  Meanwhile, school employees were regularly calling Child Protective Services.

  “He has come to school with a black eye and I remember one time it looked like a cigarette burn on his chest,” Brandon’s former teacher, Julie Gentry Tilley testified during Gray’s trial.

  The first complaint came in to CPS in 1999, when someone alleged that Brandon’s grandfather hit him with a belt and left bruises. In 2001, CPS received a complaint alleging that Brandon’s biological father hit the boy with a rope and shoved a rag in his mouth to prevent crying. In 2007, CPS got a report stating that Brandon had been bitten by his? mother and restrained and spanked by his mother’s paramour.

  Abuse was ruled out in all those cases.

  Over the years the department confirmed two neglect allegations. Once was when investigators said Holly White failed to get Brandon and his two siblings appropriate dental care, and another time the family home was “observed to present health hazards.”

  In both cases, the family was referred to support services. CPS documents don’t say what kind.

  In 2008, after Brandon was in a car accident that killed his sister, someone discovered bruises on the boy’s legs that predated the accident. Holly White admitted whipping Brandon with a belt. Abuse was ruled out.

  Shortly after that, Robert Gray began dating Holly White. Gray had a criminal history in California, had previously been charged with robbery and rape, and had served time in prison, police documents state. But during his murder trial, numerous people testified that he served as Brandon’s primary caregiver and that they’d never seen him hurt the boy.

  In the summer of 2011, after 22 complaints to Child Protective Services, Brandon and his family moved to California. While there, that state’s child protection department investigated two abuse allegations, according to Texas CPS documents.

  In March 2012, someone complained that pounding could be heard from inside Brandon’s home and that the boy was never seen. In June 2012, someone alleged that they heard Holly White’s boyfriend say “Do you want me to tie you up?” then heard sounds of a person struggling to breathe.

  California officials dismissed the allegations.

  A few months later, the family returned to Denison, Texas. But trouble was brewing. Gray wanted to put Brandon in a home for people with disabilities so he could get a job, according to the transcript for Gray’s trial. White refused to//

  On Jan. 8, 2013, Robert Gray called 9-1-1 because Brandon wasn’t breathing. When medics arrived, they found the bruised and bleeding teen lying dead on a couch. The medical examiner ruled the cause of death to be homicidal violence including positional asphyxia and ligature binding. White and Gray admitted during Gray’s trial that they regularly hogtied Brandon with strips of bed sheets.

  Olds says it didn’t have to end that way: “It was like there was nobody to help this child.”
