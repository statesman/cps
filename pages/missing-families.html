  # In some cases, families fall off state’s radar
  ## CPS has search unit, but officials don't know how many children have been found as a result of its work

  Child Protective Services caseworkers knew Colton Turner’s family well. The agency had already conducted four investigations into his care before his third birthday.

  By the time the state launched its final investigation last summer and started looking in earnest, CPS hadn’t seen the boy in six months; caseworkers were unable to locate him. Colton’s body was found in a shallow grave Sept. 12.

  When families fall off CPS’ radar, the consequences can be deadly. Between 2009 and 2014, 15 children died after the state agency lost track of them, according to an analysis by the American-Statesman of nearly 800 state child fatality reports. Some of those families were already being investigated; others went missing after they promised to participate in community services. A few disappeared before CPS could even talk to them.

  It’s a problem the state has tried to tackle. Child Protective Services has a 14-member unit called FINDRS, which was created in 1999 to help find missing families. CPS also uses their special investigators, law enforcement agencies and other means to find children.

  Between May and December, for example, FINDRS’ information directly helped investigators find 44 out of 120 missing children; 44 could not be found and another 47 cases are ongoing.

  Texas isn’t alone in its struggle to track down families that don’t want to be found. Families are more mobile these days. If they cross state lines, child protection agencies not only have a harder time finding them but also can lose jurisdiction. To combat that, CPS can seek help from other state law enforcement or child welfare agencies.

  “Missing families are an increasing problem throughout the country,” said Linda Spears with the Child Welfare League of America. “And it’s not getting any better.”

  ### Missing in plain sight

  Colton Turner was 10 months old when a caller first complained to CPS that the little boy was being abused by the boyfriend of his mother, Meagan Work. By the time Colton was pushing 3 years old, his family had been investigated four times, and his mother had slipped out of sight several times. Twice, an investigator caught up with Work and her boyfriend, Michael Turner. In March 2014, an investigator decided that Colton was safe.

  Despite additional complaints about the boy’s safety, that was the last time the agency saw him. The case fell through the cracks after caseworkers quit or went on vacation.

  Work has been charged with injury to a child and injury to a child by omission in the death of her son. Turner has been charged with injury to a child by omission.

  Child Protective Services fired three employees over the child’s death, blaming them for — among other things — failing to look for Colton. In that case, investigators did not use FINDRS. Had they done so, the unit might have searched Work’s open Facebook page, where there were pictures of Colton with bruises on his face and friends who might have helped the agency find the missing child.

  Still, FINDRS has limitations. Staffers don’t get out into the community to track down missing clients by knocking on doors or interviewing neighbors. Instead they are Internet sleuths, using government databases, social media and other resources to find addresses, phone numbers or people.

  ### The searchers

  Investigators have different opinions on how useful FINDRS is. Ashley Harris with Texans Care for Children said she used the service when she was a CPS caseworker because it allowed her to keep working on cases while FINDRS dug up information about where the families might be.

  “It was really helpful, and it was pretty effective,” said Harris, who was a caseworker for four years.

  Dimple Patel, a CPS research associate for TexProtects, said she rarely used FINDRS during her nine years as a CPS investigator and supervisor in Dallas. Instead, she and her coworkers usually relied on “special investigators” — experienced workers whose duties include finding missing families — to help them. Patel said workers called family members, knocked on doors, contacted school districts and checked public assistance. A recent state report said the value of those special investigators — who also work on their own cases — is not clear.

  But in some cases, families are just good at going underground.

  Ten years ago, 9-year-old Devontae Williams died of malnutrition with pneumonia in his family’s Arlington apartment. His mother, Marcella Williams, and her girlfriend, Lisa Ann Coleman, had been investigated for abuse and neglect more than a half dozen times. But the family moved often, and CPS couldn’t catch up with them.

  Investigators lost track of the family in 2002. When Devontae died in July 2004, he had been beaten, bore 250 scars and weighed 35 pounds.

  In September, Coleman was executed by lethal injection for the crime. Marcella Williams is serving life in prison.
