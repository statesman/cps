    Declaring that the agency charged with protecting Texas children isn’t giving the public a full accounting of the state’s abuse and neglect fatalities, a state legislator said he will push for new law compelling Child Protective Services to release details on every abuse-related death it investigates.

    A 2009 bill passed by Sen. Carlos Uresti required the child protection agency to produce public reports summarizing its investigations into abuse-related child deaths. A series of American-Statesman stories published this week, however, revealed CPS [had applied a narrow interpretation of that law](undercounting.html#skip-hero), releasing only those fatality reports in which it had determined abuse or neglect had directly caused a child’s death — 779 cases between March 2009 and March 2014.

    But the Statesman’s investigation also found that during that same time period, 655 additional children died in circumstances where abuse or neglect was present. Those reports were not made public, raising questions about whether CPS was under-reporting the true scope of the state’s child abuse problem.

    Uresti, a San Antonio Democrat, said the intent of his original law was to bring attention to all maltreatment-related child deaths. The new bill will clarify that.

    “We may not always ask the exact specific question, but give us that information so we don’t have to keep changing policies,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a team effort.”

    Uresti was one of several lawmakers who called for action following the Statesman’s three-day series of stories about Child Protective Services.

    The report found that the agency [had previous involvement](missteps.html#skip-hero) with about half the families in which a child eventually died of abuse or neglect. The analysis also discovered that in about one-fifth of the fatality cases a child had already been removed from caretakers who later were found responsible in a subsequent abuse fatality. In more than three dozen of those cases, it was the same child who later died. Critics said such findings suggest the agency had not acted quickly or aggressively enough to protect children in high-risk environments.

    Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, who chairs the senate’s Health and Human Services Committee, added that he would support broader child fatality reporting requirement from CPS, as well. He said releasing more information about all abuse- and neglect-related child deaths in the agency’s reporting is essential to give legislators and the public a more complete view of how well state regulators are combating the problem. Texas reports more child abuse fatalities than any other state, but ranks 7th nationally in its abuse fatality rate.

    “I think the reporting process needs to be improved so the public can have a full and accurate understanding of what’s really happening at CPS,” Schwertner said.

    In Washington, meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett said he found the paper’s revelations troubling and would be submitting the findings to several federal agencies for review.

    A spokeswoman for the Democratic congressman said he’d instructed his office to contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, among other agencies “to see whether some appropriate federal action should be taken to remedy some of the problems you raise,” press secretary Leslie Tisdale said. “He is also concerned that these problems extend beyond Texas.”

    The Statesman report also found that, despite CPS having a special unit dedicated to finding missing families, [15 children had died](missing-families.html#skip-hero) after the agency lost track of them. And unlike some other states, Texas [has been slow to adopt tactics](previous-removals.html#skip-hero) that use data to identify children at high risk of being harmed to prevent tragedies before they occur.

    “This reporting sheds essential light on what has happened to children who lived and died in the shadows,” Doggett said in a statement. “We need more transparency to avoid more tragedies. CPS lacks the resources to field enough well trained professionals to protect vulnerable children, but many questions are posed concerning how well it has employed the resources that it has.”
