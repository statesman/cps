  {{#child-link "42632479-717"}}Jakaela Newhouse{{/child-link}} was 67 times more likely to die than other kids her age. On Christmas Eve 2012 she became a victim of her terrible odds when her mother’s boyfriend entered their Southwest Houston apartment and shot the 12-year-old and her mother.

  In El Paso, {{#child-link "41737133-172"}}Malachi Cosby’s{{/child-link}} risk of dying was 14 times higher than other infants. Those deadly statistics played out on April 9, 2012, when the one-year-old died such a violent death that Child Protective Services recorded his death as being due to “innumerable” injuries to his head, body and extremities.

  Although they were Texas children who died, their dismal — but potentially lifesaving — calculations weren’t performed here. The numbers, called predictive analytics, are courtesy of a company hired by Florida’s Department of Children and Families to analyze details from previous child fatality cases in an effort to anticipate, and thus prevent, future abuse and neglect tragedies.

  “There are a lot of these agencies who aren’t using predictive analytics,” said Albert Blackmon, a data scientist for the North Carolina-based SAS Institute. “But it’s definitely the future.”

  Such analyses, driven by instantly accessible electronic records, are being deployed increasingly by child welfare agencies to identify in real time the children most at risk of being harmed. While Texas child protection authorities say they are in the process of forming a unit to perform such work, it is only just getting underway.

  The American-Statesman’s examination of 779 child neglect and abuse fatality reports between September 2009 and March 2014 offers a glimpse of the potentially lifesaving number crunching that is arriving too late for hundreds of kids. The paper’s review found that in 125 instances a child had been previously separated from the home prior to his or her death because of safety concerns.

  In 41 cases, the child who eventually died was the one removed from the home.

  That confirms a risk factor generally identified by child safety experts. While a previous removal is not absolutely predictive of a later fatality, “Common sense says if a family has a history of abuse, it’s putting kids at greater risk,” Blackmon said.

  {{doc "1390965-child-fatality-trend-analysis-florida-department" "Analysis of child fatalities from 2007 to mid-2013 identified key risk factors, including a child's prior removal from the home." "6"}}

  The precise numbers SAS found when analyzing Florida’s fatality cases, however, demonstrated the urgency of intervention. Each prior removal of a child increased the odds of death by a multiple of 14. In short, “A prior removal just skyrocketed a kid’s risk of dying,” he said.

  That means Malachi was at greatly heightened risk of dying. CPS records show that regulators removed the then-7-month-old from his parents in September 2011 and placed him in foster care. His aunt had noticed he wasn’t crawling and took him to the hospital, where X-rays showed “several” leg fractures his parents couldn’t explain.

  Malachi was returned to his mother two months later. Less than half a year later, he was dead. His father, Crispen Hanson, has been charged with murder. The case is pending.

  Texas has been slow to sign on to prevention measures to combat the problem. Over the past decade, the Texas State Child Fatality Review Team, a state group charged with identifying how Texas children die and recommending prevention policies, has repeatedly requested money for a program that would match up new birth data with CPS case files.

  The idea was to identify families who had a previous child abuse or neglect fatality, or parents who had their rights terminated previously, so child protection advocates could intervene early and intensively to head off future problems. But lawmakers declined to provide the funding.

  Last legislative session, legislators finally agreed to pay for the initiative when they restored about $15 million for prevention programs cut earlier. “We didn’t really target the families that needed services,” said Sasha Roscoe, DFPS’ new director of prevention and early intervention. Helping Through Intervention and Prevention started making matches in Jan. 2014.

  The program still has gaps. In some cases, the intervention is considered voluntary. Unrelated romantic partners with a child abuse or neglect history who are not listed on a birth certificate or not counted as part of a household are difficult to identify. Still, by the end of October the program had identified just over 300 families that hadn’t been on CPS’ radar previously.

  ### “This is the frontier”

  Such a data-driven program represents only the beginning of what some agencies are doing. In the Tampa area of Florida, a state whose child protection system is largely privatized and broken up by regions, a company called Eckerd was hired to stop an alarming rash of children who were killed despite being known to child protective services.

  After analyzing data from thousands of cases — in particular those in which kids were hurt or killed while a family was already on state regulators’ radar — the company identified crucial turning points where caseworkers could have made a difference. “We were looking at where did the system not do the kind of job it needed to do in order to ensure these children were safe,” said Ron Zychowski, Eckerd’s chief of quality and program performance.

  It then created a simple checklist so caseworkers could make sure those steps were followed. Since the company began the program two years ago, Zychowski said, it has not had a single neglect or abuse homicide in families the agency has accepted for services. “This is the frontier,” he said.

  Department of Family and Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins said the Texas agency has been in contact with Eckerd for more than a year to implement a similar system that would identify high-risk neglect and abuse cases and use the information to aggressively intervene before a tragedy occurs. A pilot program already has been tested in the San Antonio area with good results, he said.

  For many Texas children, such reforms are arriving too late.

  According to SAS, the future risk to a child can vary widely depending on the type of abuse that precipitated the earlier separation. Households where regulators have had to remove children because of confirmed cases of sexual abuse, for example, pose an especially high risk for future fatalities, the company found.

  That meant Jakaela faced an extraordinarily precarious future. In January 2011, she had accused her mother’s boyfriend of raping her. CPS determined it was a credible claim, records show, and Curtis James Adams was criminally charged with molesting Jakaela. Released on bond, he moved out of the house, according to state records.

  But Adams apparently kept in touch with Jakaela’s mother, LaTasha Jones. Two years ago he allegedly entered their home and shot LaTasha and Jakaela while his younger son watched. Murder charges against him are pending.


  Prior removal of a child because of concerns about a parent’s drug or alcohol abuse also places him or her at much higher risk of dying, SAS statistics show. “The impact of each prior removal due to parents who have abused alcohol or drugs increase the odds of deaths by a multiple of nearly 15,” a {{#doc-link "1390965-child-fatality-trend-analysis-florida-department#document/p6/a195620"}}company study reported{{/doc-link}}.

  Meaning {{#child-link "42396824-669"}}Deondra Garner{{/child-link}} faced an uphill battle for survival.

  When blood tests following her April 2011 birth returned positive for marijuana and cocaine, she was removed from Erica Johnson’s care and placed into state conservatorship, CPS records show. Two months earlier, two of Johnson’s other children had been placed in foster care because of her drug use as well.

  All three were returned to their mother’s care in October 2011, records show. Less than 10 months later, 15-month-old Deondra was dead of blunt force injuries to her head, according to the medical examiner’s report, which labeled her death a homicide. She also had suffered severe burns. While Johnson pleaded guilty to failing to protect Deondra from the burns, Deondra’s killing remains unsolved.
