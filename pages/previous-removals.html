  Jakaela Newhouse was 67 times more likely to die than other kids her age. On Christmas Eve 2012 she became a victim of her terrible odds when her mother’s boyfriend entered their southwest Houston apartment and shot the 12-year-old and her mother.

  In Bexar County, Adrian Bosques’s risk of dying was 60 times higher than other infants. Those deadly odds played out on Sept. 12, 2010, when, three days after his birth, he died of kidney failure brought about by his mother’s persistent drug abuse.

  Although they were Texas children who died, their dismal — but potentially life-saving — calculations weren’t performed here. The numbers, called predictive analytics, are courtesy of a Florida company hired by that state’s Department of Children and Families to analyze details from previous child fatality cases in an effort to anticipate, and thus prevent future abuse and neglect tragedies.

  “There are a lot of these agencies who aren’t using predictive analytics,” said Albert Blackmon, a data scientist for SAS. “But it’s definitely the future.”

  Such analyses, driven by instantly accessible electronic records, are being used increasingly by child welfare agencies to identify in real time the children most at risk of being harmed. While Texas child protection authorities say they are in the process of forming a unit to perform such work, it is just getting underway. The American-Statesman’s examination of every child neglect and abuse fatality case between 2009 and 2013 offers a glimpse of the potentially life-saving number-crunching that is arriving too late for hundreds of kids.

  One significant finding of the paper’s review of 789 child abuse and neglect fatalities over five years, for example: In XX instances, a child had been previously removed from the home prior to his death.

  That confirms a risk factor generally identified by child safety experts. While a previous removal is not absolutely predictive of a later fatality, “Common sense says if a family has a history of abuse, it’s putting kids at greater risk,” Blackmon said.

  Yet the precise numbers SAS found when analyzing Florida’s fatality cases demonstrated the urgency of intervention. Each prior removal increased the odds of death by a multiple of 14; a child twice removed had a 28 times greater chance of dying. In short, “A prior removal just skyrocketed a kid’s risk of dying,” he said.

  That means San Antonio’s Ethan Alatamirano was at heightened risk of dying. The 7-month-old had been removed from the care of his mother in March 2009 after CPS received two reports of injuries to his elbow, leg and testicles that she couldn’t explain. He was returned to her care in September 2010 after a year and a half separation, CPS documents show.

  Three months later, Ethan died from a severe beating. Although his mother, Janie Alatamirano, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for failing to protect her son, Bexar County prosecutors dropped murder charges against her boyfriend, Michael Pastran, for lack of evidence.

  Texas has been slow to sign on to prevention measures to combat the problem. Over the past decade, the Texas State Child Fatality Review Team, a state organization charged with identifying how the state’s children die and recommending prevention policies, has repeatedly requested money for a program that would match up new birth data with CPS case files. The idea would be to identify families who had a previous child abuse or neglect fatality, or parents who had their rights terminated previously, so child protection advocates could intervene early and intensively to head off future problems. But lawmakers declined to provide the money.

  Last legislative session, lawmakers finally agreed to fund the initiative when they restored about $15 million for prevention programs cut years earlier. HIP — Helping through Intervention and Prevention — started making matches in Jan. 2014. “We didn’t really target the families that needed services,” said Sasha Roscoe, DFPS’s new director of prevention and early intervention.

  The program still has gaps. In some cases, the agency’s intervention is considered voluntary. Paramours with a child abuse or neglect history who are not listed on a birth certificate, or not counted as part of a household, are difficult to identify. Still, by the end of October, HIP had identified just over 300 families that hadn’t been on CPS’s radar previously.

  Such a data-driven program represents only the beginning of what some agencies are doing. In the Tampa, Florida, area — the state’s child protection system is largely privatized and broken up by regions — a company called Eckerd was hired to stop an alarming rash of children who were killed despite being known to child protective services.

  After analyzing data from thousands of cases — in particular those in which kids were hurt or killed while a family was already on state regulators’ radar — the company identified crucial turning points where caseworkers could have made a difference. “We were looking at where did the system not do the kind of job it needed to do in order to ensure these children were safe?” said Ron Zychowski, Eckerd’s chief of quality and program performance.

  It then created a simple checklist for caseworkers to make sure those steps were followed. Since the company began the program two years ago, Zychowski said, it has not had a single neglect or abuse fatality in families the agency has accepted for services. “This is the frontier,” he said.

  CPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins said the Texas agency has been in contact with Eckerd for more than a year to implement a similar system that would identify high-risk neglect and abuse cases and use the information to aggressively intervene before a tragedy occurs. A pilot program already has been tested in the San Antonio area with good results, he said.

  For many Texas children, such a program arrived too late.

  According to SAS, the future risk to a child can vary widely depending on the type of abuse that precipitated the earlier separation. Households where regulators have had to remove children because of confirmed cases of sexual abuse, for example, pose an especially high risk for future fatalities, the company found.

  That meant Jakaela Newhouse faced extraordinarily grim odds. In Jan. 2011, she had accused her mother’s boyfriend of raping her. CPS determined it was a credible claim, records show, and Curtis James Adams was criminally charged with molesting her. Released on bond, he moved out of the house, according to state records.

  But Adams apparently kept in touch with Jakaela’s mother, LaTasha Jones. On Christmas Eve morning, he allegedly entered their southwest Houston home and shot both her and Jakaela while his younger son watched. Murder charges against him are pending.

  Prior removals of children because of safety concerns due to a parent’s drug or alcohol abuse also place kids at much higher risk of dying, the SAS Institute statistics show. And the risk climbs each time it happens. “The impact of each prior removal due to parents who have abused alcohol or drugs increase the odds of deaths by a multiple of nearly 15,” a company study reported.

  That means that by the time he was born, the odds of Adrian Bosque dying were sky-high.

  The first time state officials removed a child from his mother’s care was on Aug. 3, 2005, after CPS investigators responded to a report that the young boy had been burned by a space heater. (CPS reports do not name her) The mother, who already had a history of drug use, had failed to follow up on the boy’s medical care and as a result he’d needed to be hospitalized again.

  The second time she had a child legally removed was three months later, in November 2005, state records show. Soon after her baby girl’s delivery, the infant had displayed symptoms of drug withdrawal. The girl’s mother tested positive for cocaine and heroin, and admitted using drugs during her pregnancy.

  Her third child taken from her custody the following year. The infant boy was removed after she again tested positive for opiates. According to state records, the woman said she’d used her husband’s pain medication while pregnant.

  The courts removed her fourth child, too. Born with opiates in his blood from his mother’s continuing drug use, the infant boy was born prematurely in November 2009 and immediately began exhibiting symptoms of withdrawal.

  While all four children were eventually placed with other families, her fifth child wasn’t so lucky. (It is unclear how involved CPS was with the family prior to Adrian’s birth.) Born prematurely on Sept. 12, 2010, in Bexar County, Adrian Alexander Bosques lived only three days become succumbing to kidney failure, records show. His mother admitted to daily heroin use during her pregnancy, a habit that “directly contributed to the child’s condition,” records show.
