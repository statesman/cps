  # CPS chief addresses Statesman investigation
  ## Effort underway to address chronic turnover, reform agency, Specia says

  {{> photo-right page.specia}}

  Late last year, DFPS Commissioner John Specia sat down with the American-Statesman to discuss the challenges facing Child Protective Services and how the agency is tackling them.  Specia, a former Bexar judge who established the Bexar County Children’s Court, was tapped to lead DFPS in 2012.

  Parts of that interview have been transcribed and are available below.

  ### What has the agency been doing with the legislatively mandated Child Fatality Reports?

  I haven’t been doing anything with them, because I just got here 2 years ago.

  I’ve created the Office of Child Safety (September 1). After we did an audit of the child fatality review process we found it wasn’t the same all across the state. We’ve made that process uniform. We have staff whose full time job is to look at child fatalities and serious child injuries to look for patterns and modify policies.

  ---

  ### What have you been seeing?

  The safe sleep deaths are the ones that shock me. Those are completely preventable if we were to follow the recommendations of safe sleep put out by pediatricians.

  Very young children having access to a firearm. That is shocking. The drownings. Every summer we have drownings that are pure accidents, and drownings that are the result of negligence. I didn’t know that two years ago when I came here.

  ### On boyfriends or girlfriends – paramours – who injure children:

  It’s a real Catch-22 when someone has a job and they go to a job and they ask their paramour to take care of their child and then the child is injured because the person doesn’t want to be doing it and doesn’t have the capability of doing it.

  That goes directly to us being aware of who is in the home, to making sure that when we are working with a family, that we not only know the mother and the children, but who are the other people coming into regular contact with the children.

  The critical piece is knowing about the person being there. If we know about him being there, then we’re going to do the background checks. It’s where we don’t know the person is there that we have the greater risk.

  One of the problems we have, when someone has a legal relationship with the child, you can go in and get a court order. But when it’s an informal relationship, you don’t necessarily know they’re there, and I think that creates issues.

  ---

  ### On placing at-risk children with relatives:

  When I look at outcomes, our children do better in kinship homes. Children want a relationship. And the fact of the matter is now with modern technology, and social media, they’re all in contact. Termination is a legal decision, but once you become a teenager, you have access to social media, you can find a relative – you can find a terminated mother. We now need to make sure if children want to do that, that we help them do that.

  ---

  ### On the agency’s prevention budget cuts and plans:

  In the last session, we restored prevention dollars. Now, it only brought us back to where we were in 2011. I have elevated my prevention programs to be a direct report to me. We are approaching prevention in a different way.

  ---

  ### On counting child deaths:

  Every state defines fatalities differently. Texas defines it very broadly. There really is not standard of what is a child abuse fatality and what is not. It’s very hard to compare us to other states when no one is counting the same way.

  ---

  ### On caseworker performance:

  My in-the-field workers are performing the way they’re expected to when they’re not involved in child deaths. Every day they’re involved with families all over the state – there are 28,000 children in foster care today – that do not result in a death. There have been some tragedies recently where we were involved in the case and we didn’t do our job and we need to address those.

  ---

  ### On fatalities that occur during an open CPS investigation:

  It’s a very small number of cases, so we need to drill down and see what the worker did right and what the worker did wrong. Sometimes it’s just a failing of people; they don’t do their job. And where they don’t do their job we need to take personnel action. Where there’s a judgment issue, we need to see if there’s a training issue – did we miss something? If they weren’t told about domestic violence and missed cues, that’s a training issue.

  In a child death case, I can’t do anything about that child. But I can learn from that case.

  ---

  ### On families whose children have been previously removed by CPS, but are later returned and die of abuse or neglect:

  There is no more frustrating situation than the serial removal of children from the same parents.

  I will tell you: when someone has a child removed, the next time they have a child, they are not letting us know about that child. They’re doing everything they can to stay out of the system. So the (new Helping through Intervention and Prevention) program is identifying people where their rights have been terminated or there’s been a child death, and giving us an opportunity to go out and meet immediately, before there’s a referral, and check with the family to see what’s going on.

  It is voluntary. Legally, we just can’t go out and start an investigation unless there’s been a referral. If the father is not on the birth certificate, or is not known, then that creates problems by itself.

  ---

  ### On caseworker misconduct:

  My position is very clear: If you endanger a child by not doing your job, by not seeing the child when you’re supposed to see the child, that’s a firing offense. But I also will back you up if you’re following policy and there’s a bad outcome. Doctors have bad outcomes, lawyers have bad outcomes; we aren’t perfect. And our people probably have the hardest job in the world.

  ---

  ### On the latest reform plan for the agency:

  I think all the prior reforms have been external reforms. And then it was a matter of, ‘We’re going to make you do this. We’re going to give you money, and make you do this.’ This reform is something I asked for. And what I wanted to do is, let’s take a look at this organization that has a budget of $2.6 billion a year. Why isn’t it operating better?

  Our policies are ridiculous. We have way, way, way too many policies. I get tired of hearing that someone violated a policy. There’s so many policies it’s impossible for people to know what the policies are.

  ---

  ### On chronic turnover of CPS employees:

  It’s got to be a do-able job. People are going to keep leaving if they don’t understand their job and they don’t feel we’re being consistent. We’re completely re-doing our performance plans. Because they have been widget-driven.

  We are trying to completely re-do who we hire. Sometimes we have obviously hired the wrong people; we’ve hired people who just wanted a job. This is a calling; this is not a job. You can make more money in a whole lot other places. We take a lot of young people right out of college and throw them into incredibly difficult situations.

  The training is going to be 80 percent in the field, with mentors. It’s going to be much more like police academy training. You’re out there, doing the work. We’re going to be putting them out there for 30 days to see if they can stomach the job.

  We are being much more responsive to our workers; we have a full time retention specialist. We’re trying to become less bureaucratic. We’re trying to make this a place you want to work.

  ---

  ### On threats against caseworkers

  My workers are physically assaulted, they are attacked by dogs, they are threatened. Sometimes their tires are punctured. Sometimes they’re blocked by people with big bats. We are doing a lot of work in trying to support our workers who have these job-related incidents.

  Our workers have very different challenges in different parts of the state. They’ve got to be smart, creative, resilient. They do incredible jobs. What I don’t see in the paper is, ‘Today we saved a thousand children.’ Because that’s a fact.

  ---

  ### On FNDRS, the group charged with finding missing families:

  We are doing some different stuff on that right now. We have a contract with an organization that is going to help us do some sophisticated computer searches.

  We need to be using FINDRS, and we need to be coordinating more closely with law enforcement on that. They have better tools than we do. We need to be finding every child and laying eyes on them.

  ---

  ### On services aimed at making parents safer:

  Family Based Safety Service works. Three percent of the removals were from family based; lots of the families we work with never come back into the system.

  But there’s a tremendous lack of services, depending on where you are, particularly out in West Texas. If the family has a drug or alcohol problem and the only service is 100 miles away and they don’t have a car, you have a real serious problem.

  And there’s no court order. Where I see a problem is where you offer FBSS and they are not using them, they are not learning anything from the services. Then you need to take the next step and maybe go to court and get the court involved.

  ---

  ### On child death cases where CPS had previously missed signs of abuse:

  My answer to missed signs is a tenured workforce. Having a worker on the case, from start to end, that’s where we get the best results.

  It would seem if there are multiple referrals, and maltreatment is validated, the number of referrals is something you need to consider. We need to look at history.

  At some point you need to take the case to court and let the judge decide. My expectation is we don’t win every case we take to court. But we take the appropriate cases to court. But also don’t take every case to court.

  There is a gap between when parents are just not being very good parents, and when they are endangering a child. What is the right of the parent, and when does the state intervene?

  We can’t remove every child that has a bruise. Every incident does not, should not result in children being removed from homes. We need to make the right decision. Where you can provide services and make that home a safe place for the child, that’s the right thing to do.

  ---

  ### On the Statesman’s analysis of CPS death reports:

  You’ve done something nobody else has done. I want to see what the patterns are there. I’m sure my safety folks will look at it.
