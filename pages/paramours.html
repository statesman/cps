  Leroy Hutta and his girlfriend were babysitting a Dallas friend’s 1-year-old son in June 1998 when the child sustained serious injuries including burned feet, bruises around his neck and internal trauma, court records show. Hutta, then 21, was convicted of injury to a child and spent four years in prison.

  In July 2007, less than a year after Hutta’s release, his 2-month-infant son suddenly stopped breathing, according to Child Protective Services documents. Originally assumed to be a medical tragedy, an autopsy later revealed the child had died of malnutrition and “multiple fractures,” according to records.

  Three years after that, Hutta, then 33, showed up on investigators’ radar a third time. On Nov. 29, 2010, he called Irving police, saying the 4-year-old daughter of his girlfriend was unconscious. Police found De’Jhane Pollard with red marks around her throat and bruises on her chest, abdomen and legs, records show. She died at Baylor Medical Center soon after.

  Hutta was convicted of her murder in January 2013 and sentenced to life in prison. His long and brutal history of hurting children highlights what advocates say is one of the biggest challenges in monitoring and stopping child abuse deaths. Paramours — Child Protective Services’ oddly dated term for unmarriedromantic partners — pose particular challenges that the agency has not always risen to.

  An *American-Statesman* analysis of every child abuse and neglect death in Texas between 2009 and 2013 found that in 137 of the cases — about one in every five fatalities — a boy- or girlfriend of a parent was at least partially responsible for the death. In abuse homicide cases, the number is closer to a third.

  For a number of reasons, experts say having a boyfriend living in a household can be a clear warning sign that regulators need to pay closer attention to how children are being treated. Some — particularly those who are young — are reluctant and immature caregivers who use children as props to get attention or retribution from their lovers.

  “Sometimes the boyfriend will take it out on the children,” said Richard Glaser, the criminal district attorney for Fannin County, a rural community northeast of Dallas. He recently won a guilty plea from Michael-Chaz Herman, who admitted to beating to death his girlfriend’s daughter, Logan Lively, in 2012.

  Additional factors, such as a history of domestic violence or unemployment can raise additional red flags, said Emily Douglas, an associate professor of social work at Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts and author of a forthcoming book, “Child Abuse and Neglect Deaths in the United States; Three Decades of Effort.”

  Another caution sign: An unemployed boyfriend being left alone to care for a child.

  “What I’ve seen over the years is more moms working and the boyfriend caring for the child,” said Catherine Babbitt, the chief of the Bexar County District Attorney’s Family Justice Division. “It can be a lethal recipe.”

  Yet for regulators, keeping tabs on paramours is difficult. One reason is a regulatory gap: In Texas, abuse has been tracked by household and child — meaning paramours, especially, can move from family to family outside of CPS’s scrutiny.

  “If they’re out of the picture, they just go right off the radar,” said Lee County attorney Martin Placke, who has seen the consequences firsthand.

  In January 2009, Michael Allen Seaton’s girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter arrived at the local hospital with head injuries, bruising on her face and human bite marks on her. Placke, whose district lies just east of Austin, recalled the adults in the household insisted a cow had stepped on the girl. While “the evidence didn’t support that” and CPS eventually took custody of the girl, Placke said none of the adults budged from their story: “We couldn’t prove he did it.”

  Seaton eventually pleaded to a lesser charge, was sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation. He dropped out of sight — until Dec. 16, 2011. That was the day Houston police saw 4-year-old Dustyn Roff’s black eyes, cuts and the more than 100 bruises and internal injuries.

  The homicide investigation honed in on mother Britni Glover’s new boyfriend — Michael Allen Seaton. Glover said after a fight with Seaton, she watched him backhand Dustyn across the face and punch him repeatedly in the stomach and back. Seaton has been charged with Dustyn’s murder; his trial is pending.

  “I just feel terrible,” said Placke. “It’s tragic.”

  ### Girlfriends, too

  Girlfriends have also proven deadly. Last year Plano police arrested Melinda Lynn Muniz after her fiancee’s 2-year-old daughter, Grace Ford, was found in her crib with duct tape over her mouth, dead from suffocation. The father had just broken off their engagement, according to court documents. Muniz has been charged with murder.

  In Santa Fe, in Galveston County, Laura Kolb was charged with breaking the neck of her boyfriend’s daughter, 5-year-old Taylor Moore, after an argument with her father. The case is pending.

  But the vast majority of paramours responsible for Texas’s child abuse deaths are men. While most had no significant criminal backgrounds, the *American-Statesman*’s analysis found that, like Seaton and Hutta, several had troubling histories of criminal violence they carried into their new families.

  When Carinelus Simmons was found guilty of fatally dipping Jabraylon Bables, his girlfriend’s 16-month toddler, in a pot of boiling water while babysitting the boy in Dallas, it was his second brush with violent death. He’d been convicted in 1994 for killing a man outside a bar and sentenced to 14 years in prison.

  “That was way before he knew me,” Bables’ mother, Jasmine Thompson, said following her boyfriend’s Dec. 2010 arrest.

  In 2006, Nathaniel Flowers was sentenced to six years in prison and lost his parental rights after pleading guilty in Harris County to injuring his 2-month-old son. Four years later, Kameron Deshown Kelly began vomiting while Flowers was watching her in his girlfriend’s Houston home.

  He died soon after; an autopsy found two skull fractures. Flowers began serving a life sentence for the 3-month-old’s homicide in May 2012.

  CPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins said such cases highlight the challenges paramours present to caseworkers. “We knew these men had previous history with CPS, and in some cases violent criminal history, but we did not know that these men were in these homes until the death was reported,” he said.

  He added: “It’s very common for CPS to be unaware of a potentially dangerous boyfriend in the home until it is too late, and it is also very common for those boyfriends to have been involved previously with CPS.”

  Crimmins said agency policy calls for a background check on every member of a household when it investigates a complaint of abuse or neglect. CPS also has several intervention programs designed to focus extra attention on households with a history of domestic abuse, which often includes unmarried partners.

  Yet caseworkers also must balance a family’s competing needs with the newcomer’s risk: If a single mother needs her job and can’t afford daycare, for example, should the agency still demand her new boyfriend not babysit? “It’s a real Catch-22,” said Department of Family and Protective Services Commissioner John Specia.

  He added that, even if it knows about a potentially dangerous paramour with a violent history, the agency has limited authority to open an investigation without a specific referral. Another legal hurdle: While the agency can request a court order to restrict access for a relative, it’s more difficult to do with an unrelated boy- or girlfriend.

  “Even if the paramour is a bad person, I can’t order him to stay away” without a complaint, said Travis County District Judge Darlene Byrne, who hears custody cases.

  In those instances, caseworkers and judges try to exact promises from mothers. In several cases reviewed by the paper, however, CPS caseworkers who knew of a boyfriend’s troubling past asked mothers to not leave their children alone with him, only to have that vow fatally broken.

  John Pickens was charged with injuring his girlfriend’s child in January 2013, after the 16-month-old boy was injured while Pickens dragged the boy’s mother across a San Antonio parking lot during a fight. She told CPS she wouldn’t let the boy near Pickens anymore, and he was released on $5,000 bond.

  Six months later the toddler, Tre’Allen Williams, turned up dead, with bruises on his face, head and chest. San Antonio police have charged Pickens with intentional injury to a child. His case is pending.

  CPS also knew about Kerry Woodard. In 2007, records show he was convicted of sexually assaulting a minor girl and sentenced to three years in prison. Following his discharge, he moved in with his girlfriend, Valerie Mosby, in Lufkin. A January 2010 CPS investigation noted his criminal background.

  Mosby signed a safety plan, saying she realized how dangerous it was to leave her son, Zikeishun Lane, with Woodard, and moved the boy out of the house. But in October that year, Zikeishun moved back in with the couple without notifying CPS.

  Two months later, the 3-year-old was found unresponsive with no pulse. Doctors at Lufkin’s Memorial Hospital found bruises over his entire body. An autopsy discovered bleeding in his eyes, spinal cord and brain. In 2012, Woodard, who had been watching Zikeishun while Mosby worked at the nearby state-supported living center, was sentenced to life in prison for his murder.
