  Backed into a corner with only her computer case to protect her, Stacey Casey did her best to fight off the two dogs attacking her.

  The pit bull’s teeth were clamped around the Angleton caseworker’s right wrist. A little white dog tore at her arms and legs. The Child Protective Services caseworker was bleeding and screaming, but she was trapped on an apartment complex patio. There was nowhere to run.

  “Don’t fall down,” she told herself. She was sure the dogs would kill her if she did.

  Casey’s case illustrates the physical perils of being on the front lines of child abuse and neglect cases. Caseworkers walk into homes where parents are angry, armed, high or have a history of domestic abuse or a criminal record for other kinds of violence.

  And still, the devoted ones stay.

  Last summer, investigator Ashley Depeaux and supervisor Mandy Shaw were working in their Round Rock office when word spread that they were on lockdown. An angry father was calling local CPS offices, trying to find a program director he blamed for removing his children from his home. He threatened to come to the office.

  “I’ve heard voicemails from this guy,” Shaw said. “I know his criminal history. I’m concerned. If he shows up, it’s not going to be good.” Luckily, the man didn’t show up.

  While most family members pose no threat, some have threatened to kill caseworkers or bomb a CPS building. They have posted staffers’ names, home addresses and pictures on social media. They have encouraged family, friends or gang members to hurt caseworkers.

  Casey, a former stay-at-home mom, had been on the job for about a year when she went on the routine visit in November 2013. A 12-year-old girl had already been removed from her Harris County family, and, as part of her job, Casey was visiting the girl’s mother to talk about the case.

  Casey knew the family had dogs, but they had been locked up during previous visits.

  But this time, when the woman opened her door, the two dogs immediately leapt at her. Casey lurched backward to protect herself. When she did, the gate slammed shut behind her, trapping her with two vicious dogs.

  The dogs’ owner tried to pull them off Casey, but couldn’t. The dogs tore her skin; blood gushed from her wounds.

  The attack finally ended when a man jumped over the gate and beat back the dogs with a broom. Paramedics rushed Casey to the hospital. Her wrist suffered deep tissue damage, and the attack left serious scars on her leg.

  Three months later, though, Casey was back at work. She never seriously thought about quitting, she says.

  “I love my job,” said Casey, 48. “I think it’s one of a handful of jobs where you can make a difference.”

  Recently, she helped find a new home for a girl who had once lived in a filthy trailer with a meth-addicted mom. The 8-year-old — who was adopted — has gone from a traumatized child who bit, screamed and threw things to a girl who plays softball and takes dance lessons.

  “I think about where she was and where she is now and what her future is,” she said. “I know I made a difference.”
