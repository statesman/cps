  # Turnover
  ## Turnover subhed

  <p class="author">By Andrea Ball and Eric Dexheimer / Published January 13, 2014</p>

  Each month, Child Protective Services hires 200 new caseworkers. Within six months, 33 of them will quit.

  low salaries and oppressive workloads bear much of the blame. But caseworkers also battle constant stress, weak training, and safety concerns. There is a numbers-driven push to close cases and so much paperwork that they barely spend a quarter of their time working with families.

  Meanwhile, the agency is plagued by a punitive environment where caseworkers bear the brunt of the blame for failures.

  “If a child dies, the very first person hung out to dry is the caseworker, even if the evidence is that they wanted to remove the child but were overruled by the supervisor,” said Randy Burton, founder Justice for Children, a Houston-based child welfare group. “Who wouldn’t want to leave that job?”

  Turnover at Child Protective Service is a long-documented problem and every legislative session since 2005 has brought overhauls, reforms or policy changes aimed at improving the agency. And on paper, things look better.

  Since 2005, CPS has hired more than 3,100 employees, reaching 8,234 in 2013. Its staff budget has nearly doubled, from $241 million to $469 million, over that time. Overall turnover for staffers is down from 29.3 percent to 25.5 percent.

  But the numbers mask still-troubling trends.

  - More than 30 percent of investigators — the ones on the front lines of protecting children from abuse — leave each year.
  - Each month CPS hires 200 new caseworkers, but loses 100. One out of every six quits within the first six months.
  - Caseworker salaries have barely moved. In 2007, entry level investigators earned about $34,600 . Today it’s $36,700.
  - State officials say investigators generally juggle about 20 cases at a time, but a state-commissioned study recently showed stated that the real numbers vary wildly. At one point over the last year, investigators in South Texas averaged as many as 85 cases each . The Child Welfare League recommends that investigators carry no more than 12-15 cases at one time.
  - Caseworkers are so bombarded with paperwork, that they spend just 26 percent of their time with children and families.

  “When you’re just running around around checking off boxes, you’re not spending the time you need with families,” said Ashley Harris, a policy specialist with the advocacy group Texans Care for Children.

  ### Ongoing efforts

  In 2013, the constant influx and departure of new caseworkers cost Texans $72 million in retraining, rehiring and associated costs when 1,346 caseworkers quit. Staffers left behind had to pick up abandoned cases, which meant investigations were delayed and the caseworkers were held responsible for those delinquent cases — all of which contributes to more turnover.

  Every legislative session since 2005 has brought reforms. Lawmakers have tried , better equipment, privatizing foster care services, pay increases, bonuses and targeted support for new caseworkers.

  Officials have added , then taken away, tens of millions of dollars. They’ve added, then taken away, jobs. They’ve slashed the training budget by more than half since 2009 and its prevention and intervention programs lost one-third of their funding since 2010.

  The state also hasn’t tried hard hard enough to fixpoor management practices that contribute to high caseworker turnover, according to a recent report by the Texas Sunset Commission, which evaluates the effectiveness of state agencies.

  In a survey released by the department earlier this year, many workers expressed anger, frustration and a cynicism that the agency can change. <a href="docs.html?doc=1388904-stephens-grp-findings-all#document/p315" target="_blank">Their responses included</a>:

  “My supervisor is stuck in the past and expects too much out of me and makes me feel like a failure and puts me down.”

  “We suck the passion out of employees, overwhelm and oppress them!!! They just become data entry people rather than agents of change!!!!”

  “We take survey, after survey. NO ONE DOES ANYTHING.”

  Meanwhile, violence against caseworkers has grown . The number of assaults on caseworkers has jumped from just two in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 to six in 2013 and 11 in 2014.

  “My caseworkers are physically assaulted,” said John Specia, executive commissioner of the Department of Family and Protective Services. “They are attacked by dogs. They are threatened. Some of their tires are punctured. Sometimes they’re blocked by a guy with a bat.”

  State leaders say the department conducts safety briefings with workers and offers classes on e-escalating verbal conflict with aggressive clients. The agency is designing an educational campaign to heighten awareness of the risk of being assaulted. It also has a website detailing safety information for workers.

  CPS supervisors also allow caseworkers to visit homes with another staffer when conflict can be reasonably anticipated. That, however, is hard to do when staffers are swamped with their own work, said Ashley Harris, a policy specialist with the advocacy group Texans Care for Children.

  “Sometimes you go to the office and you’re the only one there and it’s 11 p.m. and you have to go check on a family,” said Harris, a former CPS investigator.

  Some CPS offices - either large ones or those where there have been incidents or threats - have security guards to protect staffers in the building during the day. Some don’t.

  “The workplace has to be safe, comfortable, and conducive to the important work they have to do,” said Patrick Crimmins, spokesman for the Department of Family and Protective Services.

  Earlier this year, CPS released a top to bottom review of the agency by the Stephen Group, which offered numerous suggestions on how to improve morale and supervision at the organization. That report triggered the lastest overhaul of the agency, one that officials hope will change the culture and help slow the ongoing exodus of its workers.

  Its initiatives include revamping its technology so caseworkers spend less time on paperwork, increasing mentoring, revising investigation policies and beefing up its prevention and early intervention programs. The agency plans to hire 700 more caseworkers and improve on-the-job training for employees and managers.

  It is also revamping the way it recruits people. Instead of sporadically looking for people at job fairs, officials say they will now collaborate with colleges to promote careers in child protection and search for people with more diverse backgrounds.

  “It’s not just rhetoric, it’s Job One around here and we’re putting everything into it,” said Family and Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins. “There is no question that attracting the best people we can to CPS, and keeping them at CPS, is the key to any turnaround.”

  CPS officials say they’re trying to turn turn the culture of the agency into one that recognizes accomplishments and treats employees fairly.

  In the past, workers say, the agency has blamed front line staff for mistakes caused, in part, by too much work and too little supervision.

  Earlier this year, the agency came under the microscope because of the way its Travis County workers dropped the case of Colton Turner, a 2-year-old boy found dead in a shallow Austin grave in September. His mother and her boyfriend are being held on charges in connection with the death.

  After a community outcry, officials fired three employees — a caseworker, a supervisor and the program director — saying the staffers had bungled its response to complaints that the boy was being abused.

  It was one of the few times the agency had punished anyone other than a caseworker in a case gone wrong. But critics note it still did not hold the office’s top staffers accountable for failing to adequately supervise its staffers.

  “That’s unacceptable because good leadership is key to running a good organization,” said Dimple Patel, who spent nine years as a investigative caseworker in Dallas until September and is now a CPS research associate with Texas Association for the Protection of Children.

  “They’re still there,” Patel said. “They’re the ones writing those termination letters.”
