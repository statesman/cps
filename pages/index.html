    <p class="lead">In 2009, the Legislature ordered Child Protective Services to publicly record every abuse- and neglect-related death in the state in hopes of identifying patterns and discovering ways to prevent abuse deaths. But the Statesman has learned that CPS has not systematically analyzed those reports, meaning that in important ways, Texas’ child protection workers effectively have been operating with blinders, missing deadly patterns and key pieces of information that could help protect kids.</p>

    {{> video-block-brightcove page.video1}}

    <p>For the last six months, Statesman reporters Andrea Ball and Eric Dexheimer analyzed each of those 779 reports and uncovered a series of troubling findings:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Texas is not publicly reporting hundreds of abuse- and neglect-related child deaths each year. Between 2010 and 2014 the Department of Family and Protective Services did not publicly report 655 child abuse-related fatalities, even though the department confirmed that those children had been mistreated prior to their deaths.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Nearly half of the children who died were already on CPS’s radar. Of those 380 fatalities, 144 families — more than a quarter — had been the subject of a CPS investigation at least 3 times. In 12 instances, CPS had seen the family 10 or more times. CPS had contact with one family more than 20 times before the child died.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>In 125 instances, a child had been previously separated from the home prior to his death because of safety concerns. In 41 cases, the child who eventually died was the one removed from the home.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>CPS doesn’t know whether its efforts to find missing kids work, hindering efforts to better help children who can be in dire danger. At least 15 kids died after they dropped off CPS’s radar.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Since 2009, more than 50 CPS workers have been caught lying to prosecutors, ignoring court orders, falsifying state records or obstructing law enforcement investigations, according to an American-Statesman review of state and court documents. At least four former CPS employees are currently facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>Of the nearly 300 child abuse homicides and suspected homicides over the past five years reveals that cases can unaccountably drag out for years. The paper also found that one of every five of child abuse beating or strangulation deaths — the way most children are killed — have been left unsolved, leaving relatives, law enforcement and local communities bereft of closure or justice.</li>

            <p>Andrea Ball has covered CPS and other social services for the paper since 2002. Her work prompted a federal investigation concluding that poor health care killed a patient at Terrell State Hospital, and she has investigated problems at the state’s centers for people with disabilities and a questionable contract with software company 21CT.</p>
