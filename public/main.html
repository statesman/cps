<h1>CPS main</h1>
<h2>CPS main subhed</h2>
<p class="author">By Eric Dexheimer and Andrea Ball / Published January 11, 2015</p>

<p>In 2009, Texas lawmakers voted to make Child Protective Services more accountable and effective by requiring it to produce a public report for every child fatality that answered the questions it always faces following such tragedies: What did regulators know, when did they know it and what did they do?</p>
<p>“What we hoped was that the different advocacy groups, CPS, every stakeholder would be able to look at this data and learn from it so we wouldn’t make the same mistakes again,” said Sen. Carlos Uresti, who sponsored the bill.</p>
<p>Yet five years on, that hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>Instead, the approximately 800 child fatality reports written between 2009 and March 2014 have been dutifully produced, and then filed way. The state doesn’t comprehensively review the reports. Neither do child welfare advocates.</p>
<p>An unprecedented American-Statesman analysis of every one of the cases — a detailed review of thousands of pages of heart-rending documentation the state itself does not perform — found that, in important ways, Texas’s child protection workers effectively have been operating with blinders, missing deadly patterns and key pieces of information that could help protect kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>The agency has not comprehensively tracked how often it saw children before they died of abuse or neglect — often a key predictor of problems. The paper’s analysis shows that in 165 of the fatalities, the agency had seen the family at least three times. In 15 instances, CPS had seen the family 10 or more times. Twice, the child protective agency had contact with a family more than 20 times before a child finally died. In November, Family and Protective Services began tracking such numbers on a statewide level.</li>
<li>CPS also doesn’t know whether its efforts to find missing kids work, hindering efforts to better help children who can be in dire danger. Like Austin’s Colton Turner, 14 other kids died after they dropped off CPS’ radar, the paper found.</li>
<li>In 146 cases — a little more than one of every five reviewed by the paper — a child had been taken from one of his or her caretakers out of safety concerns prior to the fatality. In 41 of those instances, it was the same child who later died.</li>
<li>Unlike some other states, Texas has not employed a detailed analysis of the child fatalities to identify families that are at the greatest risk of hurting a child, and use that information to prevent tragedies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper’s examination also discovered that the Department of Family and Protective Services, which has boasted of a steep decline in the number of Texas’s child abuse and neglect fatalities, may be dramatically underreporting to the public the real number of fatalities in which an adult was found culpable of mistreating children before their deaths. There are hundreds of other child fatalities in which the agency acknowledged that abuse and neglect had occurred — but decided that was not directly responsible for the child’s death.</p>
<p>By culling out such cases, officials potentially have suppressed the real toll of abuse and neglect deaths statewide.</p>
<p>State regulators collect voluminous information when a child dies - cause of death, perpetrator and CPS history, to name only a few examples. This spring, a consultant hired by the state to evaluate Texas’s child protection system from top to bottom found “CPS is awash in data.”</p>
<p>Yet The Stephen Group also concluded the agency had failed to deploy that information in ways that might protect children before they were hurt. CPS did not identify “predictive trends” and “potential ‘hot spots’ that require intervention before a bad outcome occurs,” the consultants wrote.</p>
<p>This summer, the Sunset Advisory Commission, which evaluates the effectiveness of state agencies, also urged the agency to better identify trends in childhood fatalities. “ CPS does not gather and evaluate sufficient data to most accurately assess the risk to children and the quality of services it provides,” it said.</p>
<p>By detecting critical patterns that could help the agency identify future children in acute danger and figure out what signs – if any – caseworkers might be missing, the American-Statesman’s analysis represents a first attempt at that type of work.</p>
<h3 id="most-deaths-of-any-state">Most deaths of any state</h3>
<p>While any number of abuse and neglect fatalities is unacceptably high, they represent a small portion of the child protection agency’s work. Each year, CPS investigates more than 150,000 complaints of child abuse or neglect. Most arrive by phone into its sprawling intake center in northeast Austin, where phone operators work around the clock.</p>
<p>They are often overwhelmed. Although the numbers have been improving, each year about a quarter of the callers hang up after waiting more than five minutes to speak to an operator. (The agency aims to keep hold times under 8.7 minutes.) An LED crawl running atop one of the call center’s walls changes color depending on wait times.</p>
<p>On a recent afternoon, it often flickered to yellow, meaning hold times had reached 10 minutes. Occasionally, it switched to red, meaning waits had climbed to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Of the more than 200,000 calls CPS receives, about 160,000 are investigated for abuse or neglect. In 2013, the agency verified that about a quarter of those were actual abuse or neglect cases.</p>
<p>In addition to the many complaints the agency looks into, CPS also investigates when a Texas child dies in unexpected circumstances or law enforcement or a medical facility requests a review. Those fatalities have averaged about 1,000 a year, although the number dropped to 804 in 2013.</p>
<p>The abuse and neglect cases examined by the Statesman represent the one-quarter to one-fifth, depending on the year, of all fatalities the agency investigated. The publicly reportednumber reached a recent high of 280 in 2009, and has since fallen to 156, mirroring general declines in violent crimes nationally.</p>
<p>Still, in 2013 Texas led the nation in its number of child abuse and neglect fatalities — it had 20 percent more than the No. 2 state, Florida — and ranked 7th in its maltreatment death rate. Officials said the high numbers reflected Texas’s efforts to more aggressively assign responsibility for child deaths than other states, such as co-sleeping fatalities in which a parent was found to be using alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>The newspaper’s analysis has gaps; district attorneys in Collins, Bexar and Medina counties requested that CPS withhold reports on three pending investigations. The paper did not include in its examination the 30 abuse and neglect fatalities that occurred while children were in foster care because the details CPS publicly reports in those cases is different, making direct comparisons impossible.</p>
<p>Geographically, children died from abuse and neglect in nearly half of the state’s 254 counties. Four of every ten of the fatalities were under the age of 1; more than 80 percent were under 4 years of age.</p>
<p>More boys died of maltreatment than girls by a margin of XXXX. In XX percent of the cases, a parent was the primary person responsible; in XX percent, it was a boy- or girlfriend.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, Texas’s children died of drownings and co-sleeping suffocations and being left to overheat in cars — but also of severe medical and nutritional neglect, burns, boilings, whippings, beatings, stabbings and gunshots.</p>
<p>It is a dismal compilation of Texas adults at their worst.</p>
<h3 id="fatality-reviews-incomplete">Fatality reviews incomplete</h3>
<p>In many ways, child protection is an almost impossible job. The margin of error on either side of the work is razor thin: When investigators fail to catch even a subtle sign of abuse, the consequences can be fatal. But if they act too aggressively, parents’ rights can be unfairly stripped, inflicting long-term damage on undeserving families.</p>
<p>“There’s a constant war in the policy arena over how aggressive agencies should be in terminating parental rights,” said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Most of the agency’s work is by definition reactive to complaints. But officials say they are starting to pay more attention to abuse and neglect prevention. After slashing CPS’s prevention budget by a third, the legislature restored most of the money last year. Sasha Roscoe, DFPS’s director of prevention and early intervention, says CPS intends to redirect much of that money from youth and juvenile delinquent programs, and into early childhood intervention efforts.</p>
<p>The state has made efforts to use its data. A State Child Fatality Review Team meets twice a year to review child deaths in an effort to understand risks faced by the state’s children.</p>
<p>Yet its work has been limited and in crucial ways is incomplete. Its information comes from local fatality review teams, charged with analyzing local child deaths and passing on the information for statewide review. The local teams are voluntary, however, and large chunks of the state are unrepresented. The cases they review in a given year are also typically two years old.</p>
<p>Even in those areas with active local death review teams, reporting rigor varies widely. Last year, 14 of the local teams did not enter any data from their child death reviews. Only 92 of the state’s 254 counties passed along data on 100 percent of their child deaths.</p>
<p>CPS also is supposed to identify patterns that might help the agency anticipate its future interactions with families. But that hasn’t always been done; a 2013 audit of the process found the agency “does not focus on trend analysis.”</p>
<p>“We need to do more,” conceded agency spokesman Patrick Crimmins.</p>
<p>Yet Texas, like many other states, has been slow to adopt a promising prevention tool called predictive analytics — using data from past experience to target specific high-risk future concerns before they become abuse or neglect cases.</p>
<p>In Florida, where the child welfare system is largely privatized, several companies mine data to help caseworkers better protect kids. “You need to quantify the risk factors kids are facing so you know where to place your efforts,” said Albert Blackmon, a data scientist for SAS, hired by the state in 2013 to review seven years of child fatalities to detect patterns and probabilities. Such data can provide instant access to crucial information such as why children came into care, whether the parents themselves were abused as children, the socioeconomic status of the family and other predictors of child abuse, said Greg Povolny, CEO of Mindshare, another company that contracts with Florida and other states to crunch numbers to improve safety.</p>
<p>Florida caseworkers can also use the data to perform risk analyses. Each month, Mindshare creates a “hot list” of children who show immediate red flags for possible abuse, Povolny said. That allows managers to direct caseworkers to the most urgent cases, and give caseworkers critical background information on how best to help families before someone gets hurt, he said.</p>
<p>“What typically happens is, the problems occur and it’s too late,” Povolny said.</p>
<p>Analytics also has been used to improve caseworker performance. A simple 9-point checklist created by another company, Eckerd, which manages abuse and neglect cases in the Tampa area, has virtually eliminated fatalities once a child enters the system, said Ron Zychowski, the company’s chief of quality and program performance.</p>
<p>In Texas, 80 children died between 2009 and 2013 with cases already opened by child protection workers.</p>
<p>John Specia, a former Bexar County judge appointed to lead the Department of Family and Protective Services in late 2012, promises the agency is catching up.</p>
<p>Last year, after years of ignoring the recommendation of fatality review committee members, lawmakers agreed to pay for a new program that matches birth records with CPS investigations in an effort to identify babies born into families that have already had a child die, or removed by the state. By the end of October, the Helping Through Intervention and Prevention program — HIP — had identified 300 families meeting that criteria that hadn’t previously been on CPS’s radar.</p>
<p>Last year, Specia also created a new Office of Child Safety, designed to analyze in detail CPS’s response to previous child abuse and neglect cases. The results will help direct money and prevention programs to the highest-risk families. “Now we have staff looking at those patterns,” he said.</p>
<p>Yet the program has been slow to lift off. Workers are just now being hired and the office hopes to start its work soon.</p>
