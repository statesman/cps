<p class="caption clearfix">Messages for Colton Turner are attached to balloons that were released at a prayer vigil for the boy at the Cedar Park Tree across from the Cedar Park Police Department on Saturday September 13, 2014. Hundreds gathered to remember the two-year-old boy who was found dead Friday. <em class="pull-right">Jay Janner / American-Statesman</em></p>
</div>

<p>Colton Turner had been missing for months before he was found dead in a shallow grave on September 12.</p>
<p>CPS knew Colton Turner’s family well — by the time they boy was nearly 3-years-old, they had conducted at least four investigations into his care. But after he went missing last summer, caseworkers were unable to locate him. By the time they started the search in earnest the boy had already been killed.</p>
<p>When families drop off CPS’ radar, the consequences can be deadly. Between 2009 and 2014, 15 children died after the state agency lost track of them, according to an analysis of nearly 800 state child fatality reports by the Austin American-Statesman. Some of those families were being investigated, some disappeared before CPS could even talk to them. Others went missing after they promised to participate in community services.</p>
<p>It’s a problem the state has tried to tackle. Child Protective Services has a 14-member unit called FINDRS, which was created in 1999 to help find missing families.</p>
<p>But the state has no idea how effective the team is, whether caseworkers even use it or whether it has helped them find children. The <em>American-Statesman</em> has learned that officials don’t track the quality of the information produced by FINDRS, meaning they have no idea how many of its searches result in found children.</p>
<p>CPS officials, however, are confident that FINDRS works.</p>
<p>“We believe it is successful in a majority of the cases, but we are always looking for ways to improve,” said Family and Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins.</p>
<p>Texas isn’t alone in its struggle to find families that don’t want to be found. Families are more mobile these days, said Linda Spears with the Child Welfare Agency of America. If families cross state lines, child protection agencies not only have a harder time finding them, but lose jurisdiction to take action.</p>
<p>“Missing families are an increasing problem throughout the country and it’s not getting any better,” Linda Spears with the Child Welfare Agency of America.</p>

<p>Colton Turner wasn’t even a year old when his family fell under CPS scrutiny. Over a period of two years, Child Protective Services received six reports alleging that Colton was being abused. The agency conducted four investigations.</p>
<p>He was 10-months old when a caller complained the little boy was being abused by the boyfriend of his mother, Meagan Work. By the time he was pushing 3-years-old, his family had been investigated four times and his mother slipped out of sight several times. Twice, an investigator caught up with Work and her boyfriend Michael Turner. In March 2014, an investigator decided that Colton was safe.</p>
<p>But despite additional complaints about the boy’s safety, that was the last time the agency saw him. The case fell through the cracks after caseworkers quit or went on vacation.</p>
<p>In late August, a new caseworker was assigned and began looking for Colton. By that time, police say, he had been dead for more than six weeks. Colton was found in a shallow grave in Southeast Austin on September 12.</p>

<p>Meagan Work has been charged with injury to a child and injury to a child by omission in the death of her son. Turner has been charged with injury to a child by omission.</p>
<p>Child Protective Services fired three employees over the child’s death, blaming them for —among other things — failing to look for Colton.</p>

<p>Had those staffers tried to find the boy, they could have turned to FINDRS for help. But the unit doesn’t get out into the community to help caseworkers track them down by knocking on doors or tracking down clues. Instead, they are internet sleuths, using various search engines and state databases to help them track down addresses and phone numbers or people. That information can be culled from records from sources such as law enforcement, state benefit offices, tax assessors, hospitals, shelters, social media, the U.S. Postal Service or public data companies.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 2014, the FINDRS completed more than 24,000 searches. Emergency requests, about 55 percent of the total searches, to find a family are returned to caseworkers within 24 to 72 hours. The remainder — case in which the state knows the children are safe but can’t find the parents — are finished in about 30 days.</p>
<p>Investigators have different opinions on how useful FINDRS is. Ashley Harris with Texans Care for Children said she used the service when she was a CPS caseworker because it allowed her to keep working on cases while FINDRS dug up information on where the families might be.</p>
<p>“It was really helpful and it was pretty effective,” said Harris, who was a caseworker for four years.</p>
<p>Dimple Patel, a CPS research associate for TexProtects, said that she rarely used FINDRS during her nine years as a CPS investigator and supervisor in Dallas. Instead, she and her coworkers usually used unit’s “special investigators” — experienced workers whose duties include finding missing families — to help them. Patel said workers called family members, knocked on doors, contacted school districts and checked public assistance.</p>
<p>Colton’s case also illustrates the critical information that can be found online. Had CPS searched Meagan Work’s open Facebook page, they would have found pictures of Colton with bruises on his face and friends who might have helped the agency find the missing child.</p>
<p>But in some cases, families are just good at going underground. Ten years ago, 9-year-old Devontae Williams died of malnutrition with pneumonia in his family’s Arlington apartment. His mother, Marcella Williams, and her girlfriend, Lisa Ann Coleman, had been investigated for abuse and neglect more than a half-dozen times. But the family moved often and CPS couldn’t catch up with them.</p>
<p>Investigators lost track of the family in 2002. When Devonte died in July 2004, he had been beaten, bore 250 scars and weighed 35 pounds.</p>
<p>In September, Coleman was executed by lethal injection for the crime. Marcella Williams is serving life in prison.</p>
