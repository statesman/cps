<p class="author">By Andrea Ball and Eric Dexheimer / Published January 13, 2015</p>

<p>Each month, Child Protective Services hires 200 new caseworkers. Within six months, 33 of them will quit.</p>
<p>Low salaries and oppressive workloads bear much of the blame. But caseworkers also battle constant stress, weak training and safety concerns. There is a numbers-driven push to close cases, and so much paperwork that they barely spend a quarter of their time working with families.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the agency is plagued by a punitive environment where caseworkers bear the brunt of the blame for failures.</p>
<p>“If a child dies, the very first person hung out to dry is the caseworker, even if the evidence is that they wanted to remove the child but were overruled by the supervisor,” said Randy Burton, founder of Justice for Children, a Houston-based child welfare group. “Who wouldn’t want to leave that job?”</p>
<p>Turnover at Child Protective Service is a long-documented problem, and every legislative session since 2005 has brought overhauls, reforms or policy changes aimed at improving the agency. And on paper, things look better.</p>
<p>Since 2005, CPS has hired more than 3,100 employees, reaching 8,234 in 2013. Its staff budget has nearly doubled, from $241 million to $469 million, over that time. Overall turnover for staffers is down from 29.3 percent to 25.5 percent.</p>
<p>But the numbers mask still-troubling trends.</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 30 percent of investigators — the ones on the front lines of protecting children from abuse — leave each year.</li>
<li>Each month CPS hires 200 new caseworkers but loses 100 existing workers. One out of every six new hires quits within the first six months.</li>
<li>Caseworker salaries have barely moved. In 2007, entry-level investigators earned about $34,600. Today it’s $36,700.</li>
<li>State officials say investigators generally juggle about 20 cases at a time, but a state-commissioned study recently showed that the real numbers vary wildly. At one point during the last year, investigators in South Texas averaged as many as 85 cases each. The Child Welfare League of America recommends that investigators carry no more than 12 cases at one time.</li>
<li>Caseworkers are so bombarded with paperwork that they spend just 26 percent of their time with children and families.</li>
</ul>
<p>“When you’re just running around checking off boxes, you’re not spending the time you need with families,” said Ashley Harris, a policy specialist with the advocacy group Texans Care for Children.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="ongoing-efforts">Ongoing efforts</h3>
<p>In 2013 the constant influx and departure of new caseworkers cost Texans $72 million in retraining, rehiring and associated costs when 1,346 caseworkers quit. Staffers left behind had to pick up abandoned cases, which meant investigations were delayed and the caseworkers were held responsible for those delinquent cases — all of which contributes to more turnover.</p>
<p>Every legislative session since 2005 has brought attempts at reform. Lawmakers have tried better equipment, privatizing foster care services, pay increases, bonuses and targeted support for new caseworkers.</p>
<p>But budget realities have hampered some efforts. Officials have added and then taken away tens of millions of dollars. They’ve added and then taken away jobs, prevention programs and caseworker training.</p>
<p>And the state <a class="doc-link" target="_blank" href="docs.html?doc=1388911-sunset-commission-cps#document/p9/a195597">hasn’t tried hard hard enough</a> to fix poor management practices that contribute to high caseworker turnover, according to a recent report by the Texas Sunset Commission, which evaluates the effectiveness of state agencies.</p>
<p>In a survey released by the department earlier this year, many workers expressed anger, frustration and cynicism that the agency can change. <a class="doc-link" target="_blank" href="docs.html?doc=1388904-stephens-grp-findings-all#document/p315">Their responses included</a>:</p>
<p>“My supervisor is stuck in the past and expects too much out of me and makes me feel like a failure and puts me down.”</p>
<p>“We suck the passion out of employees, overwhelm and oppress them!!! They just become data entry people rather than agents of change!!!!”</p>
<p>“We take survey, after survey. NO ONE DOES ANYTHING.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, violence against caseworkers has increased. The number of assaults on caseworkers has jumped from just two in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 to six in 2013 and 11 in 2014.</p>
<p>“My workers are physically assaulted,” said John Specia, commissioner of the Department of Family and Protective Services. “They are attacked by dogs. They are threatened. Sometimes their tires are punctured. Sometimes they’re blocked by people with big bats.”</p>
<p>State leaders say the department conducts safety briefings with workers and offers classes on de-escalating verbal conflict with aggressive clients. The agency is designing an educational campaign to heighten awareness of the risk of being assaulted. It also has a website detailing safety information for workers.</p>
<p>CPS supervisors also allow caseworkers to visit homes with another staffer when conflict can be reasonably anticipated. That, however, is hard to do when staffers are swamped with their own work, said Harris.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you go to the office, and you’re the only one there, and it’s 11 p.m. and you have to go check on a family,” said Harris, a former CPS investigator.</p>
<p>Some CPS offices, either large ones or those where there have been incidents or threats, have security guards to protect staffers in the building during the day. Some don’t.</p>
<p>“The workplace has to be safe, comfortable and conducive to the important work they have to do,” said Patrick Crimmins, spokesman for the Department of Family and Protective Services.</p>

<h3 id="culture-change">Culture change</h3>
<p>Earlier this year, CPS released a top-to-bottom review of the agency by the Stephen Group, which offered numerous suggestions on how to improve morale and supervision at the organization. That report triggered the latest overhaul of the agency, one that officials hope will change the culture and help slow the ongoing exodus of its workers.</p>
<p>The agency’s initiatives include revamping its technology so caseworkers spend less time on paperwork, increasing mentoring, revising investigation policies and beefing up its prevention and early intervention programs. The agency plans to improve on-the-job training for employees and managers.</p>
<p>It is also revamping the way it recruits employees. Instead of sporadically looking for people at job fairs, officials say they will now collaborate with colleges to promote careers in child protection and search for people with more diverse backgrounds.</p>
<p>“It’s not just rhetoric. It’s job one around here, and we’re putting everything into it,” Crimmins said. “There is no question that attracting the best people we can to CPS and keeping them at CPS is the key to any turnaround.”</p>
<p>CPS officials say they’re trying to turn the culture of the agency into one that recognizes accomplishments and treats employees fairly.</p>
<p>In the past, workers say, the agency has blamed front-line staff for mistakes caused in part by too much work and not enough supervision.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the agency came under the microscope because of the way its Travis County workers fumbled the case of Colton Turner, a 2-year-old boy found dead in a shallow grave in Austin in September. His mother and her boyfriend are being held on child injury charges in connection with the death.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p>After a community outcry, officials fired three employees — a caseworker, a supervisor and the program director — saying the staffers had bungled the response to complaints that the boy was being abused.</p>
<p>It was one of the few times the agency had punished anyone other than a caseworker in a case gone wrong. But some say CPS didn’t go far enough and should have punished higher ranking leaders in the office for failing to properly supervise their employees.</p>
<p>“That’s unacceptable, because good leadership is key to running a good organization,” said Dimple Patel, who spent nine years as a CPS investigator and supervisor until September and is now a CPS research associate with TexProtects.</p>
<p>“They’re still there,” Patel said. “They’re the ones writing those termination letters.”</p>
