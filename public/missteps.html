<p>Two-year-old <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="40259454-34">Deacon Garay</a> first told a Child Protective Services investigator that “Bully” hurt his head in July 2011.</p>
<p>During his first visit, the investigator found the Anderson County toddler had a bruise and scratches on his temple, CPS documents show. On another visit, Deacon had a bruise and cut lip. The boy’s brother told the caseworker that their stepfather, Billy Hasel, had hit Deacon before and that the child was afraid of him.</p>
<p>Despite that, the investigator ruled out allegations of abuse.</p>
<p>Two months later Deacon died of a severe brain injury, the result of a vicious beating. Hasel was later convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>When a CPS investigator visited 2 1/2-year-old <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="34107127-263">Sania Sandoval</a> in November 2009 following a series of complaints, he likewise concluded there was no evidence of maltreatment. After the child died of a beating just days later, however, doctors noted healing fractures, a cigarette burn and that she was “severely malnourished,” weighing only 16.5 pounds.</p>
<p>The American-Statesman reviewed nearly 800 child fatality reports from September 2009 through March 2014 — a dispiriting catalogue of tragedy and cruelty representing child abuse and neglect deaths reported by CPS during that time. The analysis reveals that in dozens of instances the agency charged with protecting children made fatal miscalculations before, during and after its interactions with families in crisis.</p>
<p>CPS comes into contact with tens of thousands of families every year, so the death cases represent a relatively small portion of that total. Some of the deaths were no doubt unavoidable; bad caregivers can’t always be stopped, and what may seem like an obvious sign of trouble may not be an indicator of true abuse.</p>
<p>“We can’t remove every child that has a bruise,” said John Specia, commissioner of the Department of Family and Protective Services. “Every incident does not, should not, result in children being removed from homes. We need to make the right decision. Where you can provide services and make that home a safe place for the child, that’s the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Yet the newspaper’s examination also uncovered gaps in the state’s child protection system that might have averted some of the tragedies.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It wasn’t until after the death of Cedar Park’s Colton Turner, whose family the agency had investigated twice before losing track of him, that CPS finally started tracking its cases by number of prior investigations contacts. That began in December.</p>
<p>Yet repeated contact can be an obvious red flag: The newspaper’s analysis found that nearly <a class="explorer-link" target="_blank" href="explorer.html#/previous-investigations-any">half of the children</a> who died were already on CPS’ radar. Of those 374 fatalities, <a class="explorer-link" target="_blank" href="explorer.html#/previous-investigations">144 families</a> — nearly 40 percent — had been the subject of a CPS investigation at least three times.</p>
<p>It is “unacceptable if there were clear indications that children were at risk and CPS did not act,” said Patrick Crimmins, spokesman for the Department of Family and Protective Services. “The consensus seems clear that the CPS workforce includes talented and dedicated employees whose efforts to protect children aren’t as effective as they have to be.”</p>

<p>Crimmins acknowledged that CPS has been plagued by a variety of problems, such as poor caseworker supervision, inadequate training and burdensome paperwork demands. But he added that the agency had launched a comprehensive reform effort, including a system begun two months ago that records the number of accumulated contacts caseworkers have with a family.</p>
<p>The change comes too late for many Texas children whose deaths occurred after numerous contacts with child protection workers. CPS received 17 complaints about 17-year-old <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="36432511-371">Leosha Barnett’s</a> family before the Tarrant County teen starved to death; 17 complaints about 5-year-old <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="34522989-276">Christopher Roedel’s</a> treatment before the Ector County boy was hit by a car; and15 complaints about 17-year-old Marisol Paiz’s Live Oak County family before she died of alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>Experts concede that, even with multiple complaints, proving a child has been abused or neglected is no small task. Families lie. There aren’t always witnesses. Children can’t speak or, in some cases, their stories are dismissed.</p>
<p>Yet the consequences of missing signs can be catastrophic.</p>
<p>In Ector County, District Attorney Bobby Bland recalled the beating death of 5-year-old <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="37588500-473">Zachary Dominguez</a> in February 2011 as “the most horrendous death I’ve ever seen in a child” — bruising, scalding burn marks and open sores. Zachary’s 3-year-old brother also had signs of abuse. Both parents were later sentenced to life in prison for Zachary’s death.</p>
<p>Records show the agency had received a report of abuse six months earlier. “There was an open case,” Bland said. “There were signs that would’ve been visible to a CPS worker if they’d properly examined him that would’ve prevented the death of Zachary Dominguez.”</p>
<p>A high number of investigations into a family could indicate that caseworkers are too overwhelmed with work to properly assess the danger, said Michael Petit, a member of the federal Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities.</p>
<p>It could also point to an inexperienced caseworker being misled. “When you’re new you have the propensity to believe everything everyone is telling you, including the parents,” said Dimple Patel, a CPS research associate at the child welfare organization TexProtects.</p>
<p>Having a single caseworker or team follow a family over time can help caseworkers avoid being manipulated. “Only by observing that family over time would they have some insight of what is under or behind the surface level they’re being shown,” said Laura Wolf, executive director of Court Appointed Special Advocates of Travis County.</p>
<div class="chart chart-right clearfix"><h3 class="chart-title">CPS worker turnover rate</h3><p class="chart-chatter">Even as the state has added employees to CPS and progressively spent more per worker, high turnover rates have continued to plague the agency.</p><p class="source">Source: Department of Family and Protective Services data book</p>    <div id="cps-turnover-rate"></div>
</div>

<p>Yet in Texas, experienced caseworkers have been in chronically short supply. One out of every six hired by CPS quits within the first six months.</p>
<p>Following Colton Turner’s death, the agency conducted an investigation into its own failures. It found that the investigators who’d looked into the first two allegations of abuse left the agency, leaving the subsequent investigations to caseworkers less familiar with the family’s history.</p>
<p>Even when all the protection cylinders click, officials say high numbers of prior visits to a family can simply reflect the difficult judgment calls caseworkers must make in weighing a troubled family’s legal rights against the danger to a child. “These are complicated cases,” Specia said. “When do we intervene?”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="little-time-with-clients">Little time with clients</h3>
<p>Yet the Statesman’s examination identified more than 80 cases in which CPS had opened an abuse or neglect investigation before the death occurred, raising questions about how quickly and thoroughly the agency responds to such claims.
CPS divides its initial response into two primary categories: Priority 1 cases, where a child’s immediate safety is at risk, must be initiated within 24 hours; caseworkers must open a less urgent Priority 2 case within three days. From there, they have a week to conduct a safety assessment. The in-the-field casework must be wrapped up in 45 days, according to policy.</p>
<p>Audits and studies in recent years, however, have found that the agency has struggled to meet those timetables. In Harris County, for example, more than 600 Priority 1 cases exceeded the one-day limit last year. And while the agency has shown steady improvement, in 2013 fewer than one-third of all cases met the 45-day cutoff.</p>
<p>Cases can be wrongly categorized, too. Even though Colton Turner’s family had generated three serious complaints of abuse, the third was “inappropriately downgraded to a less urgent classification,” CPS’ internal analysis of his death concluded.</p>
<p>Heavy caseloads are a concern, but a report issued this summer by the Stephen Group, a consultant hired to evaluate CPS, found deeper problems. Thanks primarily to a growing blizzard of paperwork requirements, for example, the agency’s caseworkers spent only about one-quarter of their time with clients, giving them less time to thoroughly evaluate families.</p>
<p>In some instances the consultant found CPS’ own deadlines were insufficient to protect children. While caseworkers were required to make contact with families within 24 hours of receiving referral, for example, the actual safety assessment didn’t have to be completed until a week passed, during which “the child could potentially be exposed to significant harm.”</p>
<p>Together, the obstacles dragged out the time it took to remove children from unsafe homes. While most took fewer than three months, Stephen Group auditors also found some took as many as six. The average time to close a case in which a child was removed from an unsafe home grew from 56 days in 2009 to 60 days in 2013.</p>
<p>And time can be crucial.</p>
<p>CPS caseworkers in San Angelo received a report on Jan. 20, 2012, that 8-year-old <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="39938407-31">Jacob Hovorak</a> “was out in the neighborhood day and night … unsupervised, dirty and inappropriately dressed.” Two days later, agency documents report, “before the intake information was screened for assignment, the child set a fire in a storage shed in the backyard and died of smoke inhalation.”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="like-paroled-criminals">Like paroled criminals</h3>
<p>Even when caseworkers can’t prove abuse or neglect, they often refer troubled families to parenting or anger management classes, therapy or other support programs. In 2013, CPS provided so-called family-based safety services to nearly 30,000 families.</p>
<p>“Most of them go amazingly well,” said Travis County District Judge Darlene Byrne, who hears local custody cases.</p>
<p>Yet CPS also has no clear idea how well the services help protect children in the long-term. Earlier this year, the Texas Sunset Commission recommended the Department of Family and Protective Services start tracking and reporting the number of caregivers receiving the help who later abuse another child.</p>
<p>The newspaper’s review of fatal cases showed that in a small number of instances, the support that caregivers were receiving clearly wasn’t working. Of the children who died of abuse or neglect between September 2009 and August 2013, 95 families had previously received family-based safety services; 36 were enrolled in them at the time of the child’s death.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, even caregivers who successfully completed the state’s full gauntlet of support services fail to heed the lessons.</p>
<p>In Tarrant County, <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="42396824-669">Deondra Garner</a> was removed from her mother’s care shortly after her April 2011 birth and placed in foster care. According to CPS reports, child protection workers took action based on Erica Johnson’s dismal history as a parent, which included alleged drug use and neglect of Deondra’s older siblings.</p>
<p>Johnson regained custody a half year later when she completed all her court-ordered family support services, CPS records show. The state’s oversight of the case was officially dismissed Jan. 29, 2012.</p>
<p>Six months later to the day, Deondra arrived at the hospital “unresponsive and with multiple injuries, some old and some new,” records show. Her death five days later, which the medical examiner ruled a homicide, remains unsolved, although her mother pleaded guilty to charges of failing to protect her.</p>
<p>The state removes about 12,500 children each year from their caregivers as the result of an abuse or neglect investigation. State law requires the agency to reunify children with their families if at all possible, and about one-third eventually return to a family member’s care.</p>
<p>The system is designed with numerous fail-safe mechanisms to ensure child safety while still observing parental rights. The average time for a parent to regain custody of a child removed for safety concerns is just over a year; the process is supervised by a judge who checks regularly on progress.</p>
<p>Yet, like paroled criminals who reoffend upon their release, not all parents are rehabilitated.</p>
<p>In September 2011, <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="41737133-172">Malachi Cosby’s</a> aunt noticed he’d stopped crawling and took him to the hospital, where X-rays revealed “several distal femur fractures.” A CPS investigation found reason to believe the 6-month-old’s parents were physically abusive, and Malachi was placed in foster care.</p>
<p>Records show he was returned to his family six weeks later. Five months after that, on April 9, 2012, his parents called 911 to report his death. An autopsy showed a fatal tear in his intestine caused by a blow to his stomach. His father, Fort Bliss soldier Crispen Hanson, has been charged with the murder.</p>
