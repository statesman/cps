<h6>Part 1: What is part 1</h6>
<h1 id="undercounting">Undercounting</h1>
<h2 id="undercounting-subhed">Undercounting subhed</h2>
<p class="author">By Andrea Ball and Eric Dexheimer / Published January 11, 2014</p>

<p>Texas appears to be dramatically undercounting its official tally of abuse and neglect-related deaths each year, an American-Statesman investigation into the state’s child protection system has revealed.</p>
<p>Between 2009 and 2014, the Department of Family and Protective Services did not publicly report 655 child abuse-related fatalities, even though the department confirmed that those children had been mistreated before their deaths. But because Child Protective Services caseworkers decided that mistreatement or abuse did not directly cause those deaths, state law does not require the agency to publicly reveal those numbers.</p>
<div class="chart chart-right clearfix"><h3 class="chart-title">Publicly-reported vs. unreported deaths</h3><p class="chart-chatter">Chart chatter</p><p class="source">Source: Child Protective Services, Statesman research</p>    <div id="reported-vs-unreported"></div>
</div>

<p>Yet the rationale behind those classifications have been wildly inconsistent, raising questions about how the state lists the deaths.</p>
<p>For example, in many cases the state has assigned blame for co-sleeping or drowning deaths and those cases go on its publicly reported list. But numerous similar deaths have been kept off the public list, with little explanation of why.</p>
<p>The way officials review such cases also tends to skew the number downward. Managers review only those fatalities that caseworkers have already labeled as directly caused by abuse and neglect. Last year, that resulted in 10 cases being overturned, reducing the number on the final, publicly released list.</p>
<p>Yet deaths that field staff initially determine were not due directly to abuse or neglect don’t receive that same extra level of review. The result: the system is set up only to lower the annual number of children whose deaths were attributable to neglect or abuse, and never add to it.</p>
<p>The result of these hidden cases is that the public has no true idea how many children are dying in abuse-related circumstances. Names, ages, even causes of death are off-limits. No one knows whether CPS had worked with these families before and what, if any, action had been taken to help them, effectively shielding the agency from scrutiny in those cases.</p>
<p>That stands in stark contrast to the way CPS must handle cases in which caseworkers rule that maltreatment directly killed the child. In those cases, a 2009 law requires CPS to provide to the public a detailed report on the case.</p>
<p>Sen. Carlos Uresti (D-San Antonio) — who authored that 2009 law — said he was shocked that legislators were not being provided information on all of the abuse-related cases and plans to address that in the upcoming legislative session.</p>
<p>“I’m speechless,” he said. “I want to know who these kids are. Every one of these kids has a name and has a story and would have had a life ahead of them.”</p>
<p>Family and Protective Services spokesman Patrick Crimmins say the agency wasn’t trying to hide anything. Those numbers and other aggregate information — such as the ages, genders and types of abuse and neglect — was always available to anyone who wanted it. But, until the American-Statesman, no one asked.</p>
<p>Because of the newspaper’s inquiry, the agency plans to publicly report those numbers in the future, Crimmins said. But legally, they still cannot release details on individual cases.</p>
<p>“If there’s a loophole, we’re going to fix it unless someone can convince me why we should not know all the facts,” Uresti said.</p>
<p>At issue is how officials categorize the deaths of Texas children under the age of 17.</p>
<blockquote class="sider sider-md">
<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>It’s an effort to play with the numbers to minimize their culpability<i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i></p>
<footer class="text-right">Randy Burton, founder, Justice for Children</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever CPS learns a child has died unexpectedly or under suspicious circumstances, the agency must investigate the fatality. Caseworkers must decide whether the child was abused or neglected and, if so, whether that maltreatment contributed to the death.</p>
<p>If CPS decides the abuse killed the child, that fatality goes into the state’s official child abuse death count. In 2013, that number was 156.</p>
<p>But CPS has another way of classifying abuse-related cases. In more than 100 cases per year, caseworkers have ruled that children were abused or neglected before they died, but that the maltreatment didn’t actually cause the death. In 2013, 150 child fatalities were categorized that way.</p>
<p>Yet the way deaths are treated can vary greatly. For example, Crimmins said that one type of case that likely would not be included in the official fatality count is a situation in which child riding a four-wheeler is killed. The parent might be cited for neglect, but that failure to supervise the child would not be considered to have been directly connected to the death, he said.</p>
<p>But the American-Statesman found in its reporting three reported child deaths in which a family member was blamed in such a situation. In 2009, Dakylie and DeSean Hamilton died in Van Zandt County after riding a toy four-wheeler, then being found unresponsive in a drainage ditch. CPS blamed their grandmother for the deaths, saying she failed to appropriately supervise them.</p>
<p>Investigators are not specifically trained on how to classify child deaths Instead, they use the same general methods they use in investigation.</p>
<p>“The worker does this by gathering as much information as possible about the circumstances of the death, including information gathered from medical or forensic examinations, photographs, and the autopsy of the deceased child, Crimmins said.</p>
<p>Caseworkers don’t make those decisions alone, he added. Two other CPS employees, a supervisor and a child safety specialist, must approve the ruling.</p>
<p>Advocates say the state is intentionally keeping the number of child abuse deaths artificially low. By keeping those fatalities out of the public eye, officials can minimize the scope of the problem and appease legislators, who have demanded the agency do a better job of bringing down the number of child fatalities, said Randy Burton, founder of the Houston-based Justice for Children.</p>
<p>“It’s an effort to play with the numbers to minimize their culpability,” he said.</p>
<p>And indeed, the publicly reported numbers have drastically decreased over the last five years. In 2009, the state reported 280 child abuse deaths. In 2013, CPS reported 156 child abuse deaths, a 44 percent decrease.</p>
<p>But include the unreported deaths and another picture emerges. Although total the number of unreported abuse-related deaths have decreased over the years, the drop has not been nearly as steep: just 11 percent.</p>
<p>While CPS boasts of its declining public tally, officials say they don’t know why their numbers have dropped so drastically. At a conference hosted by the Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities last year, Specia surmised it could be connected to greater efforts to publicize the the dangers of co-sleeping.</p>
<p>But Michael Petit — a commission member and president of the Washington, D.C.-based Every Child Matters — says he was immediately skeptical of that explanation.</p>
<p>“If you can’t document cause and effect, then I don’t think you have anything,” he said.</p>
<p>Other child welfare agencies across the country have been accused of manipulating numbers to look better. In Florida, the Department of Child and Family Services has come under fire for not counting 96 children in its fatality numbers over a three year period. Illinois state child welfare agency has been attacked for for not counting 11 child deaths over five years.</p>
<p>Experts say that one reason for the inconsistencies surrounding death tallies is that the definitions of abuse and neglect vary vastly across the country, leading to incomplete and inaccurate numbers of child abuse deaths.</p>
<p>The federal government hasn’t helped, giving states little guidance on how to count and report such deaths in a uniform manner, Petit said.</p>
<p>Petit agrees that not all child deaths shouldbe judged the same when it comes to blame. A drunk or high parent who accidentally rolls over and smothers a child during co-sleeping isn’t the same as a parent who is not under the influence and has no CPS history, he said.</p>
<p>But if the state cites someone for abuse or neglect in those cases, then that information needs to be made public to present a comprehensive picture of the problem, he said.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what one Dallas-based child advocacy group, TexProtects, wants CPS to do for the other cases. The group — which says the issue has been on their radar for a while — plans to ask legislators to change the law and make that information public.</p>
<p>“It’s an accountability issue,” said Dimple Patel, a CPS analyst for the group.</p>
<p>Legislators need all the information it can get if it is to make long-lasting changing to the child welfare system, Uresti said.</p>
<p>“No one needs to hide from the facts,” he said. “Full disclosure and transparency: that’s the way we can help.”</p>
