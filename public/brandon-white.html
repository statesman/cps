<p>Texas Child Protective Services was warned about <a class="child-link" href="#" data-id="42612445-97">Brandon White’s</a> family 23 times before he was killed by his mother’s boyfriend.</p>
<p>Caseworkers received complaints as early as 1999 that the Grayson County boy was being restrained, gagged, hit and neglected. His mother admitted to whipping him with a belt so hard it left bruises. Still, he remained in his home.</p>
<p>On Jan. 8, 2013, Brandon died of asphyxiation after being tied up at his Denison home. He was 15.</p>
<p>His mother’s boyfriend, Robert Gray, was convicted of murder and is serving 90 years in prison. Mother Holly White pleaded guilty to injury to a child and unlawful restraint and received a 10-year suspended sentence.</p>
<p>Patrick Crimmins, spokesman for the Department of Family and Protective Services, said an internal review “showed very poor casework.”</p>
<p>Court and CPS documents paint a picture of a troubled family that had struggled for more than a decade. Brandon had numerous physical and mental health problems, including autism, bipolar disorder, Tourette’s syndrome and seizures. Sometimes he was a sweet boy who loved music; other times he spit, bit and threw wild tantrums.</p>

<p>Kay Olds and others at the Evadale Independent School District said they suspected for years that something was amiss in the White household. Olds, a former teacher who testified at Robert Gray’s trial, said she wanted to help Brandon, so she began a relationship with the family.</p>
<p>“I went into the home to see what was going on,” Olds said. “There were no blankets, no pillows, a half a pack of crackers and a couple of packs of Kool-Aid in the house. It was really, really bad.”</p>
<p>School employees regularly called Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>“He has come to school with a black eye, and I remember one time it looked like a cigarette burn on his chest,” Brandon’s former teacher Julie Gentry Tilley testified during Gray’s trial.</p>
<p>The first complaint came to CPS in 1999 when someone alleged that Brandon’s grandfather hit him with a belt and left bruises. In 2001, CPS received a complaint alleging that Brandon’s father hit the boy with a rope and shoved a rag in his mouth to prevent him from crying. In 2007 CPS got a report stating that Brandon had been bitten by his mother and restrained and spanked by her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Caseworkers ruled out abuse in each case.</p>
<p>Over the years, the department confirmed two neglect allegations. Once, investigators said Holly White failed to get Brandon and his two siblings appropriate dental care, and another time the family home was “observed to present health hazards.”</p>
<p>In both cases the family was referred to support services. CPS documents don’t say what kind.</p>

<p class="caption clearfix">Robert Gray and Holly White, Brandon&#39;s mother, moved the family to California in 2011. There they were investigated for two abuse allegations before returning to Texas the following year. <em class="pull-right">Court document</em></p>
</div>

<p>In 2008, after Brandon was in a car accident that killed his sister, doctors discovered bruises on the boy’s legs that predated the accident. Holly White admitted to whipping Brandon with a belt, but CPS concluded there was no evidence of abuse.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, Robert Gray began dating Holly White. Gray had a criminal history in California, had previously been convicted of robbery with a weapon and had served time in prison, police documents state. But during his murder trial, numerous people testified that he served as Brandon’s primary caregiver and that they’d never seen him hurt the boy.</p>

</div>

<p>In the summer of 2011, after 23 complaints to Child Protective Services, Brandon and his family moved to California. While there, that state’s child protection department investigated two abuse allegations against the family, according to Texas CPS documents. California officials dismissed the allegations.</p>
<p>A few months later, the family returned to Denison.</p>
<p>On Jan. 8, 2013, Robert Gray called 911 because Brandon wasn’t breathing. When medics arrived, they found the bruised and bloody teen lying dead on the floor. The medical examiner ruled the cause of death to be homicidal violence including positional asphyxia and ligature binding. White and Gray admitted during Gray’s trial that they regularly hogtied Brandon with strips of bed sheets.</p>
<p>Olds says it didn’t have to end that way: “It was like there was nobody to help this child.”</p>
