<p>Sitting in the tiny living room of her South Dallas home on a cold November evening, Falencia Bullock’s legs tremble as if she is chilled; her shoulders shake uncontrollably. “I’m so sad, I’m so sad, I’m so sad, I’m so sad,” she says, weeping.</p>
<p>It’s been more than five years since her son, Jacob Jones, died from what doctors determined to be massive head trauma and internal injuries after Bullock had dropped the 3-year-old off for a custody visit with his father. His father’s girlfriend, Monique Johnson, was arrested days after Jacob’s death.</p>

<p>Yet the criminal case against Johnson has languished, bogged down in endless legal maneuvering. Court records show more than 60 postponements, including the latest in November, which delayed the case for another half year. In September, after the prosecutor informed Bullock of yet another delay, she said she was through with the justice system.</p>
<p>“They can call me on the day of the trial,” she said. (The Dallas special prosecutor for her case, Kenneth Witherspoon, did not return phone calls or emails.)</p>
<div class="chart chart-right clearfix"><h3 class="chart-title">Cases pending for years</h3><p class="chart-chatter">As of Nov. 15, 16 criminal cases against defendants accused of killing children remained pending three or more years after the deaths. The longest still-pending case was approaching six years.</p><p class="source">Source: Statesman research</p>    <div id="time-pending-chart"></div>
</div>

<p>While the capital murder case against her crawls forward, Jacob’s accused killer has been free on a personal bond. Bullock says she has run into her in their neighborhood. “It’s like getting a knife and carving me all up again,” she said. “I’m so angry, I’m so angry, I’m so angry, I’m so angry.”</p>
<p>Bullock is not alone in her frustration. An American-Statesman analysis of nearly 300 child abuse homicides and suspected homicides over the past five years reveals that cases like the one against Johnson can unaccountably drag out for years. The paper also found that 1 of every 5 child abuse beating or strangulation deaths — the way most children are killed — has been left unsolved, leaving relatives, law enforcement and local communities bereft of closure or justice.</p>
<p>In Bell County, just north of Austin, 3 of the county’s 5 child abuse homicides since 2009 remain open.</p>
<p>In the Panhandle, 13-month-old Keyaria Bowens’ death is still considered an unsolved mystery. She arrived at an Amarillo emergency room on April 9, 2011. Doctors discovered internal injuries to her head consistent with an assault, hard fall or shaken baby syndrome, according to a Child Protective Services report.</p>
<p>Keyaria died two days later. Yet, almost four years later, whoever was responsible has eluded accountability. “We’re frustrated — that’s the best word,” Potter County District Attorney Randall Sims said.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="evidence-often-lacking">Evidence often lacking</h3>
<p>Homicides generally can be difficult to solve, and some states have clearance rates barely above 60 percent. Unlike many adult killings, however, the vast majority of child abuse homicides would seem like open-and-shut criminal cases.</p>
<p>Stranger and random killings of children are virtually unheard of. Of the hundreds of child homicides analyzed by the paper as part of its review of CPS child fatality reports, only two appear to have been committed by people unknown to the family. Police almost always begin their investigations with a body and only one or two obvious suspects.</p>
<p>Despite that, experts say a series of legal and social obstacles can pose particular challenges. The result: A community’s most emotionally wrenching deaths can also be among the hardest to bring to justice.</p>
<div class="chart chart-right clearfix"><h3 class="chart-title">Unsolved beating cases</h3><p class="chart-chatter">Nearly a quarter of the state’s child beating homicides and suspected homicides between September 2009 and March 2014 remain unsolved.</p><p class="source">Source: Statesman research</p>    <div id="no-justice-chart"></div>
</div>

<p>One reason is that, unlike in adult homicide cases, <a class="explorer-link" target="_blank" href="explorer.html#/no-weapons">child deaths rarely involve weapons</a>, removing a key source of evidence. The most common injuries stem from beatings and, less often, suffocation, which can be confused with accidents or unexplained deaths such as sudden infant death syndrome.</p>

<p>One reason is that, unlike in adult homicide cases, child deaths rarely involve weapons, removing a key source of evidence. The most common injuries stem from beatings and, less often, suffocation, which can be confused with accidents or unexplained deaths such as sudden infant death syndrome.</p>
<p>After 2-month-old Abigail Couvillon died in Austin in February 2011, the Travis County medical examiner’s office concluded she’d suffocated. Yet absent any additional evidence, the pathologist added, “It is unclear as to whether this was an accidental or intentional (death).” No charges were filed.</p>
<p>Even a seemingly definitive pathologic finding can be challenged. The Dallas County medical examiner ruled that Xavier Graham’s July 2012 death was a homicide, the result of blunt force trauma to the head. But at trial in Denton County district court in September, a jury acquitted his father of murder after another physician gave conflicting testimony.</p>
<p>Conversely, an inconclusive medical finding doesn’t always mean no crime. The Brazoria County medical examiner ruled 4-month-old Aiden Walker’s April 2011 death in Freeport as “undetermined” and no charges were filed. Yet a year later, when nearby Angleton authorities were investigating the death of his brother, Jahiem, their mother, Kristi-An Walker, confessed to killing Aiden.</p>
<p>Without such a confession, even promising cases can wither. San Antonio police arrested Adrian Joe Acosta in March 2011 when the medical examiner discovered that the skull of his 9-month-old stepson, Adrian Limon, had been broken into several pieces.</p>
<p>Acosta confessed to shaking the baby and throwing him to the floor. But murder charges were dismissed two months later when the medical examiner’s office changed Adrian’s cause of death from homicide to “undetermined,” said Cliff Herberg, at the time spokesman for the Bexar County district attorney’s office. (A current spokeswoman for the Bexar County medical examiner’s office said its records don’t reflect that the death was ever officially designated a homicide.) The case is considered closed.</p>
<p>Another hurdle: Because the vast majority of children are killed by their caretakers, other sources of important evidence traditionally used by police — fingerprints, DNA — are generally useless. “You know somebody did something, but you don’t know who,” said Lee County Attorney Martin Placke. “If you don’t have the physical evidence, you have a problem.”</p>
<p>The remaining evidence can be maddeningly imprecise. For example, “Unlike what you see on TV, you can’t say exactly when the child died,” said Robert Jarvis, a former Grayson County district attorney now in private practice. “And when you have a window of four hours and three people who handled the baby during that time, how do you prove who did it?”</p>
<p>That uncertainty provides an opening for the accused to mount vigorous and prolonged defenses. The paper’s examination found that 15 of the child homicides remain pending three or more years after the crime was committed as the cases are contested in court.</p>
<p>The murder case against Brett Sealy, accused of killing 13-month-old Aleesa Jade Koepp by beating her to death, was scheduled to be heard this November. But the evening prior to the trial, a San Saba County district judge postponed it — again — until June 2015, when it will be nearly six years since Aleesa’s 2009 death.</p>
<p>“It is so frustrating,” said Linda Lane, Aleesa’s grandmother. “It’s been such a long time.”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="parents-scuttle-cases">Parents scuttle cases</h3>
<p>Abuse death investigations also rarely have disinterested witnesses. About three-quarters of all child abuse deaths involve infants and toddlers, who often have little of the public interactions older children have, such as school, activities and play dates. That means their injuries can remain hidden for long stretches of time. Frequently, the only person who sees the abuse is the perpetrator.</p>
<p>“Ninety-nine percent of the time,” said Jon West, a longtime prosecutor in several South Texas counties, “there are no witnesses.”</p>
<p>Even when other family members observe it, they can be uncooperative. Siblings may fear for their own safety. Adults unwilling to testify against each other can stymie an investigation.</p>
<p>“If there are multiple people (considered suspects) and nobody’s talking and I’ve got nothing else, I’ve got a big problem on my hands,” said Catherine Babbitt, former chief of the Bexar County district attorney’s family justice division.</p>
<p>On Jan. 13, 2011, Romeo Wright was found unconscious at his family’s apartment in Bedford, a Dallas-area suburb. Records indicate he almost certainly was beaten to death; doctors found multiple rib fractures and bruising around his eyes, suggesting head injuries.</p>
<p>An autopsy determined the 3-month-old had died from blunt force trauma to his head, and his death was ruled a homicide. Following the CPS investigation, Romeo’s 1-year-old brother was legally removed from the Wright home and placed in foster care, records show.</p>
<p>Yet his parents, the only witnesses, were uncooperative and denied knowing anything about the infant’s injuries, said Bedford Police Deputy Chief Les Hawkins. “We just didn’t have enough evidence to bring a case,” he said. Romeo’s death remains unsolved.</p>
<p>When an unresponsive 9-month-old Jaden Sanders was taken from a Rodeway Inn to a San Antonio hospital in July 2012, he had ample signs of abuse, according to state records: a cigarette burn on his forehead and scalp, head lacerations, and bruises over much of his body, including one that appeared to be a bite mark.</p>
<p>An autopsy concluded his death was a homicide. Only two adults were living in the motel room, prosecutors said. Unable to determine which had hurt Jaden, police filed charges against both Jaden’s mother, Aliesha Sams, and her boyfriend, Anthony Arista, according to the Bexar County district attorney’s office.</p>
<p>Yet the charges were subsequently dropped against both. “We weren’t able to establish which of the persons who had custody of the child committed the offense,” said Herberg. Jaden’s death remains categorized as an unsolved homicide, he said.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="some-convictions-unsatisfying">Some convictions unsatisfying</h3>
<p>Like many states, Texas boasts a felony charge for caregivers who fail to help a child they know is being abused — injury to a child by omission. It is a way to punish not only the actual abuse perpetrator but also a passive observer to the crime.</p>
<p>In four cases reviewed by the paper, prosecutors obtained only an omission conviction — leaving the primary perpetrator free, a case half-solved.</p>
<p>In July 2012, 15-month-old Deondra Garner arrived at a Tarrant County hospital “unresponsive and with multiple injuries, some old and some new,” according to CPS records. “The child died as a result of head injuries that were not consistent with the explanation provided by mother or father.” Deondra also had a serious burn on her foot that had been left untreated.</p>
<p>When it came to finding a culprit for her death, however, Arlington police detectives hit a wall. Although only two people were with Deondra when she sustained her injuries, “neither person could be eliminated as a suspect,” said Melody McDonald Lanier, a spokeswoman for the Tarrant County district attorney’s office. “Conversely, neither suspect would implicate the other.”</p>
<p>Deondra’s mother, Erica Johnson, was eventually sentenced to 10 years deferred adjudication, no prison time, for failing to obtain medical treatment for her daughter’s foot burn. But “without proof that one person acted alone or that both suspects acted in concert in inflicting the injuries, the investigation regarding the death of the child remains open,” McDonald Lanier said.</p>
<p>Several of the child abuse homicides reviewed by the paper led to criminal convictions with arguably unsatisfying outcomes.</p>
<p>In Morris County, in Northeast Texas, 2-month-old Emily Lirette died in November 2009 from injuries consistent with shaken baby syndrome, according to state records. Her father, Dustin Lirette, was convicted of manslaughter two years later. He spent less than six months in prison before being released on probation. District Attorney Steve Cowan declined to comment.</p>
<p>In Tyler County, east of Huntsville, prosecutors initially sought a capital murder conviction for the mother of 6-month-old Brandel Goebel, whose October 2009 death the medical examiner ruled a homicide by blunt force trauma. But they eventually settled on a lesser charge, resulting in a two-year prison sentence. “We’re not real excited about it,” prosecutor Dan Hunt told the local paper in 2011.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-forgotten-death">A forgotten death</h3>
<p>Because there is no statute of limitations on murders, investigations can be kept open indefinitely. Occasionally police catch a break, typically when an adult breaks his or her long silence.</p>
<p>Originally thought to be a drowning, 4-year-old Anna Gonzalez’s 1991 death was changed from accident to homicide when the medical examiner found bruises on the back of her head consistent with blows. Yet the case languished for more than two decades until Fort Worth police reopened it in 2013 after being contacted by Anna’s half sister. Last May, Tarrant County prosecutors charged Anna’s stepmother, Juanita Gonzalez, with murder. Her case is pending.</p>
<p>Yet such breakthroughs are uncommon. “Generally, cases do not get better with time,” Babbitt said.</p>
<p>Four years after Daiyzha Johnson-Wright, 4, died from her beating injuries, Killeen police remain stymied. “Do you have information on this crime?” a Bell County Crime Stoppers alert pleaded in July.</p>
<p>In at least one instance, a child homicide appears to simply have fallen off the shelf, lost to time and the criminal justice churn. Jayden McDaniel’s mother’s boyfriend said he found the infant boy not breathing in his crib at their Tyler home on the morning of Nov. 25, 2008, records show.</p>
<p>But physicians discovered the 1-month-old had a skull fracture, as well as bruising to his shoulders, back, neck and penis. Jayden was moved to a hospice facility; he died from his injuries 2 1/2 years later.</p>
<p>Donald Martin, a spokesman for the Tyler Police Department, said officers considered the case a homicide and forwarded their findings to the Smith County district attorney’s office to file charges. But Assistant District Attorney Thomas Wilson said prosecutors never received the information.</p>
